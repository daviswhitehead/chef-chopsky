# Chef Chopsky V2: Iterations After First Use

## Context

This document initiates the second major iteration of Chef Chopsky, the custom GPT designed to help users plan, prep, and batch-cook healthy, plant-based meals—especially using CSA box ingredients. The first version of Chef Chopsky was guided by the initial instructions found in `chef-chopsky-custom-gpt.md` and informed by product documentation in the `/product` directory.

## Purpose

The goal of this thread is to systematically improve Chef Chopsky's custom GPT instructions based on real-world feedback from the first meal-planning and cooking experience. This will ensure the assistant becomes more effective, user-friendly, and aligned with actual user needs and preferences.

## Goals

- Capture and analyze feedback from the first use of Chef Chopsky for meal planning and prep.
- Identify areas where the assistant's instructions, workflow, or tone can be improved.
- Iterate on the custom GPT instructions to address pain points, enhance strengths, and better support the intended user experience.
- Document changes and rationale for future reference and continuous improvement.

**Next Steps:**

1. Gather and review first-use feedback.
2. Propose and discuss specific improvements to the instructions.
3. Update the custom GPT instructions accordingly.

## Feedback To-Do List

We will address each of these feedback categories one-by-one to iteratively improve Chef Chopsky:

- [x] Flavor & Cuisine Preferences
  - Capture and support preferred cuisines, flavor profiles, and openness to discovery.
- [x] Recipe & Source Integration
  - Integrate favorite cookbooks, websites, or specific recipes as sources.
- [x] Meal Flexibility & Variety
  - Support flexibility (e.g., savory/sweet options) and user-driven meal variety.
- [x] Convenience & Meal Prep
  - Prioritize quick, reheatable, and office-friendly meal options.
- [x] Skill-Building & Independence
  - Teach techniques, offer pro tips, and encourage user independence in the kitchen.
- [x] Ingredient Utilization & Pantry Integration
  - Suggest creative uses for CSA/pantry items and DIY projects (e.g., kimchi, yogurt).
- [x] Feedback on Specific Meals
  - Analyze past meals, suggest improvements, and track dislikes/preferences.
- [x] Aesthetic Preferences
  - Clarify and support user preferences for food appearance or style.

1. Flavor & Cuisine Preferences
   What types of food do you gravitate towards? E.g. Asian, spicy
   Eat food of places where it's hot when it's hot
   Suggestions within flavor profile, but also discovery / broadening suggestions
   Ability to be directive on what I'm feeling like eating
   Questions:
   Would you like to set default flavor/cuisine preferences, or specify them each week?
   How adventurous do you want the assistant to be in suggesting new cuisines/flavors?

2. Recipe & Source Integration
   I like cooking from this cookbook, or this recipe. E.g. Run Fast Eat Slow
   Questions:
   Should the assistant prioritize recipes from your favorite cookbooks/websites?
   Would you like to upload/link recipes for the assistant to reference?

3. Meal Flexibility & Variety
   Wanna be able to have flexibility in the meals. E.g. savory and sweet option for breakfast
   Ability to be directive on what I'm feeling like eating
   Questions:
   Should the assistant always offer a variety (e.g., both savory and sweet options)?
   How much variety do you want in a given week (e.g., different cuisines, meal types)?

4. Convenience & Meal Prep
   Ability to quickly heat up and eat the meal for busy work days or pack for office lunch
   Would like more focus on as fast as possible. Cooking
   Questions:
   Is speed of prep or speed of reheating more important?
   Any preferred reheating methods (microwave, stovetop, etc.)?

5. Skill-Building & Independence
   Train you to feel independent as a chef, gain more experience, teach us to do it ourselves without needing you. E.g. Serious Eats style advice "lemon in the dish is key because of x y z"
   When we started using lemon and fresh herbs, we leveled up. What else are we missing?
   Would like more unsolicited advice on how to do things efficiently. Productively, optimally, or like a professional chef
   Questions:
   Would you like a “pro tip” or “why this works” section in each recipe?
   How much detail do you want in skill-building advice (quick tips vs. in-depth explanations)?

6. Ingredient Utilization & Pantry Integration
   Incorporate pantry items
   We realized we get a lot of CSA cabbage and we could turn that into kimchi... Might it suggest healthy or fun ways to make other things from scratch like yogurt
   Questions:
   Should the assistant always suggest ways to use up common CSA items or pantry staples?
   Are you interested in more DIY/fermentation/preservation projects?

7. Feedback on Specific Meals
   The fish and pesto don't go that well together. How could we have improved this in the way we prepared things?
   Too much lemon
   I don't really like plain fried fish. Cooked it too dry
   Questions:
   Would you like the assistant to analyze past meals and suggest improvements?
   Should it track dislikes and avoid repeating them?

8. Aesthetic Preferences
   Prefer drab to pollack
   Questions:
   Is this about food appearance, flavor, or something else? (Please clarify “drab to pollack”)
