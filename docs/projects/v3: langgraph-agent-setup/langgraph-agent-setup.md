# Chef Chopsky V3: LangGraph Agent Setup

## Overview

This document outlines the successful integration of LangGraph into the Chef Chopsky project, creating a sophisticated AI agent with retrieval capabilities for CSA-based meal planning and cooking assistance.

## What We Built

### 🎯 **LangGraph Agent with Retrieval**
- **Framework**: LangGraph (JavaScript/TypeScript)
- **Vector Store**: Memory Vector Store (for development)
- **Retrieval**: Semantic search over cooking knowledge
- **Agent Type**: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) agent

### 🏗️ **Architecture**
```
Chef Chopsky Agent
├── LangGraph Graph (retrieval_graph)
├── Memory Vector Store (sample cooking data)
├── OpenAI GPT-4o-mini (response generation)
├── Text Embeddings (text-embedding-3-small)
└── Development Server (port 2024)
```

```

## Key Features Implemented

### ✅ **Working Agent**
- Responds to cooking questions with retrieved context
- Uses Chef Chopsky personality and expertise
- Handles CSA ingredient queries effectively

### ✅ **Memory Vector Store**
- Sample cooking documents (quinoa, kale, tomatoes)
- User-specific metadata
- Semantic search capabilities

### ✅ **Test Script**
- Command-line testing interface
- Two streaming modes:
  - `--stream` or `-s`: Word-by-word streaming
  - Default: Complete state after each step
- LangChain-compatible logging format

### ✅ **Development Environment**
- LangGraph development server (port 2024)
- TypeScript support with proper ESM configuration
- Hot reloading and debugging capabilities

## Sample Interaction

**Input**: "I have kale, tomatoes, and quinoa from my CSA. What should I cook for dinner?"

**Agent Process**:
1. **Query Generation**: "I have kale, tomatoes, and quinoa from my CSA. What should I cook for dinner?"
2. **Document Retrieval**: Finds relevant cooking info for quinoa, kale, tomatoes
3. **Response Generation**: Creates comprehensive recipe with instructions, macros, and tips

**Output**: Complete Kale, Tomato, and Quinoa Salad recipe with Lemon-Tahini Dressing, including:
- Detailed ingredient list
- Step-by-step cooking instructions
- Estimated macros per serving
- Pro tips and variations

## Technical Implementation

### **Configuration**
```javascript
const config = {
    configurable: {
        userId: "chef-chopsky-user",
        embeddingModel: "text-embedding-3-small",
        retrieverProvider: "memory",
        searchKwargs: { k: 3 },
        responseSystemPromptTemplate: "You are Chef Chopsky, a helpful cooking assistant specializing in CSA-based meal planning and high-protein plant-based recipes.",
        responseModel: "gpt-4o-mini",
        querySystemPromptTemplate: "Generate a search query for cooking questions.",
        queryModel: "gpt-4o-mini"
    }
};
```

### **Streaming Modes**
- **`"messages-tuple"`**: Word-by-word streaming (verbose)
- **`"values"`**: Complete state after each step (structured)

### **Test Commands**
```bash
# Default mode (values streaming)
node test-agent.js

# Word-by-word streaming
node test-agent.js --stream
node test-agent.js -s
```

## Current Status

### ✅ **Completed**
- [x] LangGraph agent setup and configuration
- [x] Memory Vector Store with sample data
- [x] Test script with multiple streaming modes
- [x] Development server integration
- [x] Chef Chopsky personality and prompts
- [x] End-to-end agent testing

### 🚀 **Next Steps (Priority Order)**

#### 1. **Frontend Integration** (RECOMMENDED FIRST)
**Why**: Immediate user value, validates architecture, builds momentum
- Connect existing Next.js chat interface to LangGraph agent
- Replace current AI chat route with LangGraph agent calls
- Handle streaming responses in the UI
- Create seamless user experience

#### 2. **LangSmith Integration** (HIGH VALUE)
**Why**: Monitor performance, debug issues, track costs
- Set up LangSmith API keys and tracing
- Monitor agent performance and user interactions
- Track token usage and retrieval effectiveness
- Debug production issues

#### 3. **Chef Chopsky-Specific Data** (CONTENT STRATEGY)
**Why**: Replace generic data with real cooking knowledge
- Create comprehensive cooking knowledge base
- Index CSA-specific content and recipes
- Add dietary preferences and meal planning data
- Improve retrieval quality and relevance

#### 4. **Production Vector Store** (SCALABILITY)
**Why**: Memory Vector Store doesn't persist between restarts
- Set up Pinecone, Elasticsearch, or MongoDB
- Migrate from Memory Vector Store
- Configure production environment
- Handle real user data persistence

#### 5. **Deployment** (PRODUCTION READY)
**Why**: Make Chef Chopsky available to real users
- Deploy LangGraph agent to production
- Set up monitoring and logging
- Handle production traffic and scaling

## Additional Opportunities

### 🧪 **A/B Testing Framework**
- Test different retrieval strategies
- Compare response quality
- Optimize for user satisfaction

### 📱 **Mobile App Integration**
- Leverage React Native Web architecture
- Native mobile experience for meal planning
- Offline recipe access

### 🔄 **Multi-Agent Workflows**
- Separate agents for meal planning vs. recipe generation
- Specialized agents for different dietary needs
- Agent orchestration for complex workflows

### 🎨 **Enhanced UI Features**
- Visual recipe cards
- Ingredient substitution suggestions
- Meal planning calendar integration

## Technical Notes

### **Dependencies Resolved**
- Updated Pinecone to v5+ for compatibility
- Installed LangGraph SDK for client integration
- Removed unused Express dependencies
- Fixed TypeScript ESM configuration

### **Development Workflow**
1. Start LangGraph dev server: `langgraph dev` (port 2024)
2. Test agent: `node test-agent.js`
3. Monitor logs and debug as needed

### **Key Files**
- `agent/langgraph.json`: Graph configuration
- `agent/src/retrieval_graph/graph.ts`: Main agent logic
- `agent/src/retrieval_graph/retrieval.ts`: Vector store implementation
- `agent/test-agent.js`: Testing interface

## Success Metrics

### **Technical Metrics**
- Agent response time < 5 seconds
- Retrieval accuracy > 80%
- Successful streaming implementation
- Zero critical errors in production

### **User Experience Metrics**
- User satisfaction with meal recommendations
- Time saved in meal planning
- Reduction in food waste
- Cooking skill improvement over time

## Conclusion

The LangGraph agent integration represents a significant milestone in Chef Chopsky's development. We now have a sophisticated AI agent capable of:

- Understanding CSA ingredients and cooking contexts
- Retrieving relevant cooking knowledge
- Generating comprehensive meal plans and recipes
- Maintaining Chef Chopsky's helpful, expert personality

The next logical step is frontend integration to create a complete user experience, followed by production deployment and continuous improvement based on real user feedback.
