**Me**

Now, assume you're a highly successful solopreneur and consumer product founder.

I'd like to take the Chef Chopsky concept to the next level and turn it into a product anyone can easily use.

Please take everything you know about the idea and help me break it down into some foundational product planning elements. As an example, I'd like to start creating some of these things:

- Vision
- Value Props
  - Jobs To Be Done
- Scenarios
- Feature Library

Also, use your knowledge as an expert and suggest other foundational product planning elements to formulate and feel free to ask me questions.

Perfect ‚Äî we're now shifting from prototype to **foundational product planning**. You're essentially developing _Chef Chopsky_ as a consumer AI assistant that's accessible, lovable, and genuinely useful. Let's break it down like a real founder would, using proven product strategy frameworks.

## üß† Questions For You

To shape this into a full roadmap, I'd love to know:

1. Who _besides you two_ might use Chef Chopsky? (Other demographics you care about?)
2. Would you want it to live inside ChatGPT, or eventually be a standalone web or mobile product?
3. How much of the nutrition vs cooking vs meal planning triangle is most important to you?
4. Do you imagine _teaching Chopsky_ your food preferences over time or having it detect preferences automatically based on feedback?
5. Would you want social/community features eventually? (e.g. "Davis's Favorites", family cookbooks, meal battles?)

Once you reply, I can help flesh out a **MVP roadmap**, **user flows**, and even early **branding concepts** if you want to start turning this into a real product pitch or launch plan.
