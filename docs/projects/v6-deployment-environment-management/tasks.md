## Phase 2 â€” Environment Management & CI/CD (Days 2â€“5)

### Objectives
- Add staging, automate deployments, and formalize env configuration.

### Tasks
- [x] 2.1 Create staging Vercel environment (separate project/environment) [Owner: Human]
  - Sub-tasks:
    - [x] 2.1.a Create Vercel project/environment for staging
    - [x] 2.1.b Configure staging env variables/secrets in Vercel
    - [x] 2.1.c Verify preview domains and routing
- [x] 2.2 Create staging Supabase project and env vars [Owner: Human]
  - Sub-tasks:
    - [x] 2.2.a Create project; apply schema; enable backups
    - [x] 2.2.b Generate anon/public keys; set in Vercel staging
- [x] 2.4 Add env validation at startup and production guards [Owner: AI assist]
  - Sub-tasks:
  - [x] 2.4.a Fail fast in production if required keys are missing/placeholders (agent)
  - [x] 2.4.b Add clear console warnings in non-prod mock modes (agent)
  - Note: Frontend startup validation still pending
- [x] 2.5 Configure env-driven retriever/embedding (`RETRIEVER_PROVIDER`, `EMBEDDING_MODEL`) [Owner: AI assist]
  - Sub-tasks:
    - [x] 2.5.a Read `RETRIEVER_PROVIDER` and `EMBEDDING_MODEL` from env
    - [x] 2.5.b Defaults: local `memory`, staging `pinecone`, prod `pinecone`/`elastic`/`mongodb`
- [x] 2.6 Add per-env vector index/namespace (`LANGCHAIN_INDEX_NAME`, `MONGO_NAMESPACE_PREFIX`) [Owner: AI assist]
- [x] 2.7 Ensure env discriminator in retrieval filters (`env=local|staging|production`) [Owner: AI assist]
- [x] 2.8 CI: Automated production deployment on `main` [Owner: Human]
  - Sub-tasks:
    - [x] 2.8.a Configure workflow triggers and required secrets
    - [x] 2.8.b Add deploy notifications
- [x] 2.9 CI: Staging deployments on feature branches [Owner: Human]
- [x] 2.10 Monitoring: deployment notifications wired to CI [Owner: Human]
- [x] 2.11 Update docs/runbooks: secrets, env setup, rollback [Owner: AI assist]
- [x] 2.12 Tests: health checks, env separation checks pass on CI [Owner: Human]

### Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Staging reachable, gated by access control (Note: Access control gating delayed - framework ready, manual configuration pending)
- [x] Env config validated at startup; production cannot run with placeholders
- [x] Retriever/provider and embeddings configurable via env per environment
- [x] No cross-env data bleed (validated by per-env index + filters)
- [x] CI deploys staging and production successfully

### Dependencies
- Staging setup before CI staging deploys
- Env variables and secrets before CI runs

## Phase 3 â€” Advanced Monitoring & Documentation (Days 6â€“7)

### Tasks
- [ ] 3.1 Add Sentry (frontend + agent); set DSN per env
- [ ] 3.2 Configure performance monitoring where appropriate
- [ ] 3.3 Create maintenance procedures and troubleshooting guides
- [ ] 3.4 Add deployment rollback procedure and checklist
- [ ] 3.5 Validate metrics/alerts dashboards

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Error monitoring active with alerts
- [ ] Docs complete and actionable
- [ ] Runbooks verified

## Cross-Cutting Tasks

- [ ] 4.1 Ensure `.env.example` files include new env vars (frontend/agent)
- [ ] 4.2 Update `scripts/setup-environment.sh` guidance as needed
- [ ] 4.3 Verify `.github/workflows` use env/secrets correctly

---

## Backlog (Future)

### Auth + User-Scoped Retrieval (separate project)

- [ ] 5.2 Supabase RLS policies for user-scoped documents (pantry, notes)
- [ ] 5.3 Pinecone metadata schema `{ user_id, org_id?, env, doc_id, type }`
- [ ] 5.4 Sync worker: Supabase â†’ Pinecone upsert/delete with retries
- [ ] 5.5 Post-retrieval authorization check against Supabase before returning data
- [ ] 5.6 E2E tests for user isolation

### Local Supabase via CLI
- [x] 6.1 Adopt Supabase CLI (Docker) for local development DB
- [x] 6.2 Add scripts: `supabase:start`, `supabase:stop`, `supabase:reset`
- [x] 6.3 Create `.env.local.example` with local Supabase URL/anon key
- [x] 6.4 Document migrations flow: `db reset` locally; `db push` staging/prod
- [x] 6.5 Update docs to reflect that hosted `chef-chopsky-local` has been repurposed as `chef-chopsky-staging` to stay within free tier limits

**Environment Mapping:**
- **Local**: Supabase CLI (Docker) - `http://127.0.0.1:54321`
- **Staging**: Hosted Supabase project `chef-chopsky-staging` 
- **Production**: Hosted Supabase project `chef-chopsky-production`

### Staging Access Control
- [ ] 6.6 Implement staging access control (password or IP allowlist) [Owner: Human]
  - Sub-tasks:
    - [ ] 6.6.a Add password-gate middleware for staging environment
    - [ ] 6.6.b Configure `STAGING_PASSWORD` environment variable
    - [ ] 6.6.c Add `X-Robots-Tag: noindex` header for staging
    - [ ] 6.6.d Test access control and cookie-based auth

---

## Owners & Roles
- Human: accounts, CI/CD wiring, staging access control, secret management
- AI assist: configuration templates, validation scripts, documentation scaffolding

---

## Notes
- Keep costs under <$50/mo; prefer free tiers initially
- Favor Pinecone for retriever in staging/prod; memory for local
- Maintain per-env isolation with index/namespace + `env` filters
