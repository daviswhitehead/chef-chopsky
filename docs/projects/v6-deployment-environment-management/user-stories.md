# User Stories: Deployment & Environment Management

## Environment Strategy Recommendation

Based on your constraints and requirements, I recommend a **3-environment strategy**:

### 1. **Local Development** (Your current setup)
- **Purpose**: Active development and testing
- **Access**: Localhost only
- **Database**: Local Supabase instance or shared dev database
- **Cost**: Free
- **Management**: Manual start/stop

### 2. **Staging Environment** (Preview/Testing)
- **Purpose**: Test changes before production
- **Access**: Private URL (password protected or IP restricted)
- **Database**: Separate Supabase project
- **Cost**: Free tier or minimal cost
- **Management**: Automated via CI/CD

### 3. **Production Environment** (Public)
- **Purpose**: Live application for users
- **Access**: Public URL
- **Database**: Production Supabase project
- **Cost**: Pay-as-you-go
- **Management**: Automated via CI/CD

## Detailed User Stories

**Priority**: Medium  
**Effort**: Low (2-3 hours)

#### Story 2.3: Environment-Safe Retriever & Embeddings Configuration
**As a** developer  
**I want** retriever provider and embedding model to be configurable per environment  
**So that** local, staging, and production use appropriate providers and avoid data bleed

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] `RETRIEVER_PROVIDER` and `EMBEDDING_MODEL` read from environment
- [ ] Per-env vector index/namespace via `LANGCHAIN_INDEX_NAME` (Elastic/Pinecone) or `MONGO_NAMESPACE_PREFIX` (MongoDB)
- [ ] Documents and queries include environment discriminator (e.g., `env`)
- [ ] Defaults: Local `memory`, Staging `elastic-local` (or shared dev), Prod `elastic`/`pinecone`/`mongodb`

**Priority**: High  
**Effort**: Low (2-3 hours)

### Epic 3: CI/CD Pipeline
**Goal**: Automate deployment and testing processes

- [ ] Deployment logs and monitoring

**Priority**: High  
**Effort**: Medium (4-5 hours)

#### Story 3.2: Staging Deployment Pipeline
**As a** developer  
**I want** automated deployment to staging  
**So that** I can test changes before production

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] GitHub Actions workflow for staging deployment
- [ ] Automatic deployment on feature branch push
- [ ] Staging environment cleanup after testing
- [ ] Integration with pull request process
- [ ] Staging deployment notifications

**Priority**: Medium  
**Effort**: Medium (3-4 hours)

### Epic 4: Monitoring & Maintenance
**Goal**: Ensure application reliability and ease of management

#### Story 4.1: Basic Uptime Monitoring

- [ ] Uptime monitoring service configured (e.g., UptimeRobot)
- [ ] Email/SMS alerts for downtime
- [ ] Monitoring dashboard accessible
- [ ] Historical uptime data available
- [ ] Alert thresholds configured (e.g., 5 minutes downtime)

**Priority**: High  
**Effort**: Low (1-2 hours)
