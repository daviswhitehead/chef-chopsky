- `scripts/validate-staging-environment.sh` - Environment validation

### ‚úÖ Documentation
- `docs/projects/v6-deployment-environment-management/staging-setup-guide.md` - Complete setup guide
- `docs/projects/v6-deployment-environment-management/staging-environment-status.md` - Status tracking
- `docs/projects/v6-deployment-environment-management/STAGING_SETUP_COMPLETE.md` - This summary

## Environment Configuration

### Staging URLs (After Manual Deployment)
- **Frontend**: `https://chef-chopsky-staging.vercel.app`
- **Agent**: `https://chef-chopsky-staging.up.railway.app`
- **Health Check**: `https://chef-chopsky-staging.up.railway.app/health`

### Environment Variables Configured
- **NODE_ENV**: `staging`
- **LANGCHAIN_PROJECT**: `chef-chopsky-staging`
- **FRONTEND_URL**: `https://chef-chopsky-staging.vercel.app`
- **RETRIEVER_PROVIDER**: `memory` (cost-optimized)
- **EMBEDDING_MODEL**: `openai/text-embedding-3-small`
- **LANGCHAIN_INDEX_NAME**: `chef-chopsky-staging`
- **APP_ENV**: `staging`

## Next Steps (Manual Deployment Required)

### 1. Create Vercel Staging Project
```bash
# Go to https://vercel.com/dashboard
# Create new project: chef-chopsky-staging
# Set root directory to: frontend/
# Configure environment variables from frontend/.env.staging
```

### 2. Create Supabase Staging Project
```bash
# Go to https://supabase.com/dashboard
# Create new project: chef-chopsky-staging
# Apply database schema from production
# Update frontend/.env.staging with new Supabase credentials
```

### 3. Create Railway Staging Project
```bash
# Go to https://railway.app/dashboard
# Create new project: chef-chopsky-staging
# Set root directory to: agent/
# Configure environment variables from agent/.env.staging
```

### 4. Validate Deployment
```bash
# Run validation script
./scripts/validate-staging-environment.sh

# Expected results after deployment:
# ‚úÖ Environment Configuration: PASS
# ‚úÖ Frontend Accessibility: PASS
# ‚úÖ Agent Health: PASS
# ‚úÖ CORS Configuration: PASS
```

## Cost Optimization Features

### Free Tier Usage
- **Vercel**: Free tier (100GB bandwidth, unlimited static)
- **Railway**: Free tier (100GB bandwidth, 1GB RAM)
- **Supabase**: Free tier (500MB database, 2GB bandwidth)
- **OpenAI**: Shared with production (pay-per-use)

### Estimated Monthly Cost
- **Staging**: $0-5/month (mostly OpenAI API usage)
- **Production**: $20-30/month (Pinecone + higher usage)

## Environment Isolation

### Data Separation
- **Database**: Separate Supabase projects
- **Vector Store**: Different index names (`chef-chopsky-staging` vs `chef-chopsky-production`)
- **LangSmith**: Separate projects for tracing
- **Logs**: Separate logging streams

### Security Features
- **Access Control**: Password protection for staging
- **API Keys**: Same keys as production (monitor usage)
- **Environment Variables**: Separate configuration per environment

## Validation Results
