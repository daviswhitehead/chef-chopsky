# Tactical Phase Guide

*Making the 5-Phase AI Development Playbook super tactical and actionable*

## ðŸŽ¯ Overview

This guide provides tactical, actionable instructions for working through each phase of the AI Development Playbook. Each phase now has specific Cursor rules that define exactly what the AI should do, how it should facilitate the process, and what deliverables to create.

## ðŸš€ How to Use This Guide

### 1. Start with Phase-Specific Cursor Rules
Each phase has a dedicated Cursor rule that provides:
- **Clear AI role and responsibilities**
- **Specific facilitation instructions**
- **Step-by-step process guidance**
- **Success criteria and quality gates**
- **Ready-to-use prompts**

### 2. Use the Phase Execution Template
For each phase, copy the `phase-execution-template.md` and customize it for your specific project and phase requirements.

### 3. Follow the Tactical Process
Each phase follows a structured process with clear steps, deliverables, and success criteria.

## ðŸ“‹ Phase-by-Phase Tactical Approach

### Phase 1: Intent Capture
**Cursor Rule**: `101-intent-capture-phase.mdc`

#### AI's Role
- Refine and clarify the intent document
- Identify potential challenges and edge cases
- Suggest improvements to problem definition
- Generate initial user stories and acceptance criteria

#### Tactical Process
1. **Intent Document Review** - AI analyzes and improves the problem statement
2. **Problem Analysis** - AI identifies solution approaches and constraints
3. **User Story Creation** - AI generates stories with acceptance criteria
4. **Validation and Refinement** - AI ensures completeness and quality

#### Key Prompts
```
"I'm starting the Intent Capture phase for [project name]. Let me review the intent template and help you define a clear problem statement, success criteria, and user stories. What's the core problem you're trying to solve?"
```

#### Deliverables
- Intent document (complete and validated)
- User stories with acceptance criteria
- Risk assessment and mitigation strategies
- Success criteria and metrics

### Phase 2: Roadmap Creation
**Cursor Rule**: `102-roadmap-creation-phase.mdc`

- Implementation plans for complex tasks
- Quality gates and acceptance criteria

### Phase 4: Collaborative Execution
**Cursor Rule**: `104-collaborative-execution-phase.mdc`

#### AI's Role
- Execute assigned development tasks
- Generate code, documentation, and tests
- Perform initial quality checks
- Suggest optimizations and improvements

#### Tactical Process
1. **Task Analysis** - AI reviews requirements and plans approach
2. **Implementation** - AI executes tasks with high quality
3. **Testing and Validation** - AI writes tests and validates work
4. **Review and Optimization** - AI reviews and suggests improvements

#### Key Prompts
```
"I'm starting the Collaborative Execution phase for [task name]. Let me analyze the requirements and create a high-quality implementation that meets the acceptance criteria. I'll follow the established coding standards and include comprehensive testing."
```

#### Deliverables
- Working software components
- Comprehensive tests and documentation
- Quality reports and validation
- Progress tracking and status updates

### Phase 5: Continuous Refinement
**Cursor Rule**: `105-continuous-refinement-phase.mdc`

#### AI's Role
- Implement feedback and suggested changes
- Optimize performance and code quality
- Update documentation and tests
- Suggest additional improvements

#### Tactical Process
1. **Feedback Analysis** - AI analyzes feedback and plans changes
2. **Implementation of Changes** - AI implements feedback and improvements
3. **Optimization and Enhancement** - AI optimizes performance and quality
4. **Documentation and Testing** - AI updates docs and tests

#### Key Prompts
```
"I'm starting the Continuous Refinement phase. Let me analyze the feedback and suggestions, implement the required changes, and optimize the implementation for better performance and quality."
```

#### Deliverables
- Refined product features
- Performance optimizations
- Updated documentation and tests
- Next iteration planning

## ðŸŽ¯ Making Each Phase Super Tactical
