- Optimize performance and address technical debt
- Plan next iteration based on learnings
- Enhance processes and team productivity

## ðŸ‘¤ Solo Entrepreneur Reality

### **Multiple Hat Wearing**
As a solo entrepreneur, you'll need to embody multiple roles simultaneously:

**Strategic Roles:**
- **Product Manager** + **Business Stakeholder** + **Domain Expert**
- **Engineering Manager** + **Software Architect** + **Tech Lead**

**Execution Roles:**
- **Senior Engineer** + **DevOps Engineer** + **QA Engineer**
- **Designer** + **User Researcher** + **Marketing**

### **AI as Your Team**
AI can effectively take on these roles:
- **Junior Engineer**: Implementation, testing, documentation
- **Research Assistant**: Market research, competitive analysis
- **Technical Writer**: Documentation, specifications
- **Code Reviewer**: Quality checks, best practices
- **Project Coordinator**: Task tracking, progress updates

## ðŸŽ¯ Role Distribution by Phase

### **High Human Involvement**
- **Intent Capture**: Vision, strategy, business decisions
- **Roadmap Creation**: Prioritization, resource planning
- **Continuous Refinement**: Feedback analysis, iteration planning

### **High AI Involvement**
- **Task Decomposition**: Technical breakdown, implementation planning
- **Collaborative Execution**: Coding, testing, documentation

### **Balanced Collaboration**
- **All Phases**: AI provides analysis, suggestions, and execution support
- **Human provides**: Judgment, creativity, strategic decisions
- **AI provides**: Research, implementation, optimization

## ðŸ”„ Context Switching Guidance

### **Phase 1: Intent Capture**
**Focus on**: Product Manager + Business Stakeholder mindset
**Key questions**: What problem are we solving? Who has this problem? What does success look like?

### **Phase 2: Roadmap Creation**
**Focus on**: Engineering Manager + Software Architect mindset
**Key questions**: What are the dependencies? How should we sequence this? What resources do we need?

### **Phase 3: Task Decomposition**
**Focus on**: Senior Engineer + Tech Lead mindset
**Key questions**: How do we break this down? What's the implementation approach? Who should do what?

### **Phase 4: Collaborative Execution**
**Focus on**: Senior Engineer + Product Manager mindset
**Key questions**: Is this meeting the requirements? How's the quality? What needs to be improved?

### **Phase 5: Continuous Refinement**
**Focus on**: Product Manager + Senior Engineer mindset
**Key questions**: What did we learn? What should we improve? How do we plan the next iteration?

## ðŸš€ Benefits of Role-Aware Approach

### **For Solo Entrepreneurs**
- **Clear context switching** between different mindsets
- **Better decision-making** with role-specific frameworks
- **More realistic collaboration** with AI as team members
- **Systematic approach** to wearing multiple hats

### **For AI Collaboration**
- **Role-aware prompts** that guide AI behavior
- **Context-specific guidance** for different situations
- **Better suggestions** based on current role context
- **More effective facilitation** of human-AI collaboration

## ðŸ“š Integration with Phase Rules

Each phase rule (101-105) now includes:
- **Human roles** for that specific phase
- **Role-specific AI prompts** for different contexts
- **Context switching guidance** for solo entrepreneurs
- **Decision-making frameworks** for each role

This makes the playbook more tactical and realistic for solo entrepreneurs working with AI as a collaborative partner.
