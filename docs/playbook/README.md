## Best Practices

### For Solo Entrepreneurs
- Start with small, well-defined projects
- Maintain comprehensive documentation for AI context
- Use quality gates to ensure project success
- Iterate and improve the process based on experience

### For AI Collaboration
- Provide clear context and requirements
- Use the defined roles and responsibilities
- Follow the quality gates and review processes
- Maintain consistent communication and feedback

## Success Metrics

- **Project Completion Rate**: Percentage of projects completed successfully
- **Time to Market**: Time from intent to first deliverable
- **Quality Score**: Code quality, test coverage, and user satisfaction
- **AI Utilization**: Percentage of tasks completed by AI
- **Process Efficiency**: Time saved through AI collaboration

## Common Use Cases

### Web Applications
- React/Next.js frontend development
- Node.js backend services
- Database design and implementation
- API development and integration

### Mobile Applications
- React Native cross-platform development
- Native iOS/Android development
- Backend service integration
- User interface and experience design

### AI/ML Projects
- Model development and training
- Data pipeline implementation
- API service development
- Integration with existing systems

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **AI Output Quality**: Provide more specific requirements and use quality gates
2. **Context Loss**: Maintain comprehensive documentation and consistent structure
3. **Scope Creep**: Refer back to intent document and non-goals regularly
4. **Resource Allocation**: Clearly define roles in task breakdown

### Getting Help
