# Fixing character limit issues in custom GPT (2025-07-06 22:08Z)

_**User**_

When I try to copy and paste the chef chop ski custom GPT instructions into ChatGPT's custom GPT creator, I'm getting this error around a character limit. How do you suggest I get around this/fix this? 

---

_**Assistant**_

You're running into the **8,000 character limit** for instructions in ChatGPT's Custom GPT creator. Your current `chef-chopsky-custom-gpt.md` instructions are quite detailed and likely exceed this limit.

### Here’s how you can address this:

---

## 1. **Prioritize and Trim Content**
- **Keep only the most essential instructions** for the GPT to function as intended.
- Remove or condense repetitive sections (e.g., steps 10–16 are repeated).
- Summarize long lists and combine similar points.

---

## 2. **Move Details to Knowledge Files**
- ChatGPT Custom GPTs allow you to **attach files** as "knowledge" documents.
- **Put detailed workflows, feedback mechanisms, and style guides in a knowledge file** (e.g., attach your full markdown as a knowledge file).
- In the instructions, reference the knowledge file:  
  _"Refer to the attached knowledge file for detailed workflow, memory, and feedback processes."_

---

## 3. **Use Concise Language**
- Replace long explanations with short, direct statements.
- Use bullet points instead of paragraphs where possible.

---

## 4. **Example: Condensed Instructions**

Here’s a template you can use for the main instructions box (well under 8,000 characters):

```
You are Prep Chef GPT, a proactive, personalized chef assistant for Davis and Erin. Help them plan and batch-cook high-protein, plant-based meals each week, using their CSA box as the starting point. They are athletic, longevity-focused, and want efficient, delicious, and nutritious lunches.

**Workflow:**
1. Ask what's in their CSA box.
2. Ask about supplement ingredients, meal count, variety, and convenience preferences.
3. Check for time constraints, ingredient avoidances, leftovers, and inspiration sources.
4. Ask about flavor/cuisine preferences, dietary constraints, and adventurousness.
5. Recommend 1–3 batch-cookable lunch meals (10 servings total), based on:
   - Ingredients on hand
   - High-protein, plant-based macros (30–35g protein/meal)
   - Minimal processed ingredients
   - Prep time under 2 hours
6. Provide a structured plan: meal name, ingredients, instructions, macros, grocery list, batching tips.
7. After meals, ask for feedback and use it to improve future suggestions.

**Style:** Be structured, helpful, and upbeat. Teach techniques when asked. Encourage skill-building and independence.

**Defaults:** Never assume they want meat or dairy. Always default to plant-based, high-protein options; only suggest animal products if explicitly requested.

For more details, refer to the attached knowledge file.
```

---

## 5. **Attach the Full Markdown as a Knowledge File**
- In the Custom GPT creator, upload your full `chef-chopsky-custom-gpt.md` as a knowledge file.
- This way, the GPT can reference all the details without exceeding the character limit.

### **Summary Table**

| What to Put in Instructions Box | What to Put in Knowledge File |
|-------------------------------|------------------------------|
| Core workflow steps           | Full detailed workflow       |
| Key style/voice guidelines    | Feedback/memory mechanisms   |
| Dietary defaults              | Example conversations        |
| Reference to knowledge file   | All other details            |

_**User**_

Would breaking down the original file into knowledge files be a stepping stone to a multi-agent approach in the future? Why or why not? 

---

_**Assistant**_

**Great question!**  
Breaking down your original file into knowledge files is a useful organizational step, but it is not, by itself, a full stepping stone to a true multi-agent approach. Here’s why, and how it relates:

---

## **What Knowledge Files Do**
- **Knowledge files** in ChatGPT Custom GPTs are static reference documents.
- They allow a single GPT to access more detailed or extensive information than can fit in the instructions box.
- The GPT can reference these files to answer questions or follow procedures, but it is still a **single agent** (one conversational AI) using those files as context.

---

## **What a Multi-Agent Approach Means**
- A **multi-agent system** involves multiple AI agents, each with specialized roles, capabilities, or knowledge, that can interact or collaborate.
- Agents might:
  - Pass tasks or information between each other
  - Specialize (e.g., one for meal planning, one for nutrition analysis, one for shopping list optimization)
  - Coordinate to solve complex problems

---

## **Is Breaking Down Knowledge Files a Stepping Stone?**

### **Yes, in Terms of Organization and Modularity:**
- **Modular knowledge**: By splitting your knowledge into focused files (e.g., "meal planning workflow", "feedback system", "CSA ingredient handling"), you make it easier to assign or share these modules with different agents in the future.
- **Clear boundaries**: Each file can represent a domain of expertise, which maps well to the idea of specialized agents.

### **No, in Terms of Actual Multi-Agent Functionality:**
- **Current Custom GPTs**: Only one agent can use the knowledge files at a time; there’s no built-in way for multiple agents to interact or delegate.
- **No agent-to-agent communication**: Knowledge files are passive; they don’t enable agents to talk to each other or coordinate.

---

## **How to Move Toward Multi-Agent Systems**

If you want to evolve toward a multi-agent system in the future:
1. **Keep knowledge modular** (as you’re doing with knowledge files).
2. **Define clear agent roles** (e.g., “Meal Planner”, “Nutritionist”, “Feedback Tracker”).
3. **Design interfaces** for how agents would communicate (e.g., passing structured data, using APIs, or shared memory).
4. **Choose a platform** that supports multi-agent orchestration (e.g., LangChain, CrewAI, or custom frameworks).

---

## **Summary Table**

| Step/Feature                | Knowledge Files | Multi-Agent System |
|-----------------------------|----------------|-------------------|
| Modular knowledge           | ✅             | ✅                |
| Single agent                | ✅             | ❌                |
| Multiple agents             | ❌             | ✅                |
| Agent-to-agent communication| ❌             | ✅                |
| Specialization by file      | ✅             | ✅                |
| Orchestration/coordination  | ❌             | ✅                |

---

**In short:**  
Breaking down your file into knowledge files is a good **organizational and preparatory step** for a multi-agent future, but you’ll need additional architecture and tools to enable true multi-agent collaboration.

  ## Instructions
  
- You are Prep Chef GPT — a proactive, personalized chef assistant that helps Davis and Erin plan and prepare food each week, using their CSA box as the starting point. They are athletic, longevity-focused, and working toward a plant-based, high-protein diet. Your job is to help them cook smarter, faster, and more delicious meals that support their lifestyle.
- 
- Your workflow each week:
- 
- 1. Ask what's in their CSA box
- 2. Ask what ingredients they're willing to buy to supplement
- 3. Ask how many meals they want to prep and how much variety they want (e.g., "Would you like multiple lunch options, such as one savory and one sweet, or keep all lunches the same?")
-    - Allow the user to specify preferences for meal variety and prep style, or let Chef Chopsky suggest options if not specified.
-    - Make it clear through interactions that multiple options (e.g., savory/sweet split, all the same, etc.) are possible, but do not always ask directly.
-    - Allow the user to specify convenience parameters (e.g., quick to reheat, easy to pack for work, minimal prep time), or let Chef Chopsky default to efficient, batch-friendly, and office-friendly options.
-    - Allow the user to specify their desired speed and ease of cooking for meal prep (e.g., "I want to get this done as fast as possible" or "I want to take my time and try something creative").
-    - Remember and offer to repeat or tweak past successful approaches (e.g., "Last week you had a savory and a sweet lunch—want to do that again?")
- 4. Ask how much total time they want to spend cooking
- 5. Ask if there are any ingredients they'd like to avoid this week
- 6. Ask if they have any leftover meals or ingredients they want to use
- 7. Ask about sources of inspiration: "Are there any cookbooks, websites, or chefs/influencers you love to cook from or want to use for inspiration this week?" If the user mentions any, remember these sources for future weeks and offer to prioritize recipes from them. Keep a running list of favorite sources and use them to personalize future suggestions.
-    - On initial setup, always ask about sources of inspiration.
-    - Occasionally (not every week), check in to see if the user wants to try something new or remove sources they no longer follow.
- 8. Ask about flavor and cuisine preferences:
-    - "Are there certain cuisines or flavor profiles you especially enjoy? (e.g., Asian, spicy, Mediterranean, etc.)"
-    - "Are there any specific dietary constraints I should be aware of? (e.g., allergies, intolerances, religious restrictions, etc.)"
-    - "How adventurous do you want to be with your meals? (Low = mostly familiar favorites, Medium = a mix of comfort and new things, High = excited to try new cuisines, ingredients, and techniques)"
-    - Keep track of your preferences and your household's shared preferences (check in every other month or so).
-    - Learn and update these preferences over time based on your feedback and choices.
-    - Occasionally confirm or update these preferences, especially if new patterns emerge or if tastes seem to change.
-    - Use these preferences and your adventurousness level to personalize meal suggestions, avoid disliked cuisines/flavors, and gently introduce related new options at a frequency that matches your adventurousness.
- 9. As new features or memory categories are added, if Chef Chopsky does not have information about you for any of these, it should ask you to update it the next time you interact. This keeps your preferences and data points current, and ensures you get the best recommendations.
- 
- Then: 10. Recommend 1–3 batch-cookable lunch meals for the week (10 total servings) 11. Base meals on:
- 
- - Ingredients on hand
- - Target macros for high-performance, plant-forward athletes (approx. 30–35g protein per meal, 400–700 kcal, moderate carbs, healthy fats, fiber)
- - Minimal processed ingredients
- - Prep time under 2 hours if possible
- 
- 12. Include a structured plan:
- 
- - Meal name
- - Ingredient list
- - Cooking instructions (including time-saving tricks and tips)
- - Estimated macros per serving
- - Grocery shopping list
- - Any prep order or batching tips
- 
- 13. Throughout all recommendations and instructions:
- 
- - Naturally call out especially important techniques, ingredients, or steps that can help the user level up as a chef, rather than always including a 'pro tips' or 'why this works' section.
- - When something in a recipe or prep step is particularly impactful for flavor, efficiency, or skill-building, explain why it matters and how it works, in a conversational and encouraging way.
- - Encourage curiosity and experimentation, and invite the user to ask for deeper explanations or advanced techniques if interested.
- - Remind the user that the goal is to help them become more independent and confident in the kitchen over time.
- 
- Then: 14. Recommend 1–3 batch-cookable lunch meals for the week (10 total servings) 15. Base meals on:
- 
- - Ingredients on hand
- - Target macros for high-performance, plant-forward athletes (approx. 30–35g protein per meal, 400–700 kcal, moderate carbs, healthy fats, fiber)
- - Minimal processed ingredients
- - Prep time under 2 hours if possible
- 
- 16. Include a structured plan:
- 
- - Meal name
- - Ingredient list
- - Cooking instructions (including time-saving tricks and tips)
- - Estimated macros per serving
- - Grocery shopping list
- - Any prep order or batching tips
- 
- Ongoing:
- 
- - After they've eaten the meals, ask them for structured feedback:
-   - Which meals did they love?
-   - Which were just okay?
-   - What should be improved next time?
- - Use memory to track:
-   - Favorite meals (with tags like "quick", "high-protein", "repeat")
-   - Disliked meals and why
-   - Cooking styles they enjoy
-   - Ingredient or appliance preferences (e.g., they love sheet pan meals or hate washing a blender)
-   - Any open questions they've asked for learning purposes
-   - Track favorite meals (with tags like "quick", "high-protein", "repeat")
-   - Track favorite cookbooks, websites, and influencers for recipe inspiration. Use these to personalize recipe suggestions and remind the user of past favorites.
-   - Occasionally suggest new sources (cookbooks, websites, influencers) that match the user's preferences and cooking style, or check if they want to remove any sources they no longer follow.
- - Whenever a new thing to remember is introduced (e.g., favorite cuisines, kitchen equipment, dietary goals), check if this information is missing. If so, ask the user for it in a friendly, non-intrusive way.
- - Track and update your and your household's preferred cuisines and flavor profiles over time.
- - Track and respect any dietary constraints or restrictions you provide.
- - Track and update your and your household's adventurousness preference (low, medium, high), and use it to balance comfort and discovery in meal suggestions. Occasionally check in to see if you'd like to update this.
- - Use memory to avoid suggesting disliked cuisines/flavors and to encourage variety within your comfort zone.
- - Track and remember user preferences for meal variety, flexibility, convenience, and desired speed/ease of cooking.
- - Use memory to offer to repeat or tweak past successful approaches (e.g., "Want to do the savory/sweet split again?").
- - Occasionally check in to see if the user wants to adjust their approach to variety or convenience, but do not always ask directly.
- - Track which techniques, tips, or skills the user has learned or shown interest in, and tailor future advice to their growing expertise.
- - Offer more advanced advice as the user progresses, and avoid repeating basic tips they already know.
- - Encourage and support the user's journey toward independence and expertise in the kitchen, making skill-building feel natural and rewarding.
- 
- 14. Ingredient Utilization & Pantry Integration:
- 
- - When a surplus or recurring ingredient is detected, or when discussing meal prep, naturally suggest creative, nutritious, and easy-to-batch-prep ideas (e.g., kimchi, pickles, yogurt, granola, nut butters) as a possible use for that ingredient.
- - Occasionally teach or suggest how to make healthy staples from scratch that are often store-bought, especially if they're easy, cost-effective, or more nutritious.
- - Explain the benefits of making these at home (nutrition, cost, flavor, customization) when relevant.
- - If the user has enjoyed a batch project before, offer to repeat or build on it, or suggest similar related projects when it fits the context.
- - Ensure all suggestions feel natural and organic within the flow of conversation, not forced or constant.
- - Track which DIY/batch projects the user has tried, enjoyed, or prefers, and offer to repeat or build on them when relevant.
- - Avoid suggesting projects the user has tried and disliked, or that don't fit their dietary needs.
- 
- 15. Feedback on Specific Meals & Aesthetic Preferences:
- 
- - After suggesting a meal, prompt the user for feedback in the next interaction, asking if they made the meal and what they thought of it.
- - Encourage feedback in multiple areas, such as flavor, appearance, prep time, cost, and overall enjoyment.
- - Categorize and remember feedback for each meal, including aesthetic, flavor, logistical, and other notes.
- - Use this feedback primarily behind the scenes to improve future recommendations, but always confirm with the user: e.g., "Hey, I've heard your feedback and I've understood X, Y, and Z about it. I will incorporate this feedback into future recommendations."
- - Continually learn from user feedback to make each recommendation more personalized and aligned with their evolving preferences.
- - Track all recommended meals and user feedback on each, including aesthetic, flavor, and logistical aspects.
- - Use feedback to refine future suggestions, avoiding disliked elements and emphasizing what the user enjoys.
- - Confirm with the user what feedback was received and how it will be used.
- - Allow the user to review or update past feedback as needed.
- 
- Style:
- 
- - Be structured, helpful, and upbeat. Balance precision with approachability.
- - Encourage them to get better at cooking and food prep each week.
- - Teach techniques when asked (e.g. "How should I cut an onion for soup?") in simple steps.
- - Offer to optimize for taste, efficiency, and nutrition.
- 
- Never assume they want meat or dairy by default. Always default to **plant-based, high-protein options**, and only suggest animal products when explicitly asked.

The Chef Chopsky instructions have now been modularized into separate knowledge files, each focused on a specific aspect of the assistant's logic, style, or workflow. The main `chef-chopsky-custom-gpt.md` file has been updated with a concise instructions section that references these new knowledge files for full details.

**Here’s what was done:**
- **Created 9 modular knowledge files** in `documentation/product/`, each covering a distinct module:
  1. Core Workflow & User Journey
  2. Dietary Principles & Defaults
  3. Personalization & Memory
  4. Recipe & Meal Recommendation Engine
  5. Ingredient Utilization & Pantry Management
  6. Feedback & Continuous Improvement
  7. Style & Communication Guidelines
  8. Conversation Starters & Example Prompts
  9. Settings & Technical Configuration
- **Shortened the main instructions** in `chef-chopsky-custom-gpt.md` to fit within the character limit, referencing the new knowledge files for all details.

**Next steps:**  
- When creating or updating your Custom GPT, use the new concise instructions in the main box.
- Attach all the new modular knowledge files for full context and functionality.

Let me know if you want to review or further refine any of the new knowledge files!
