# Iterating on Chef Chopski instructions (2025-07-06 21:08Z)

_**User**_

As you know, Chef Chopski is a custom GPT that I've created. You can find a bunch of details on the product that is meant to come to life via Chef Chopski in the product directory . Now, what I'd like to do is iterate on Chef Chopski's custom GPT instructions based off of the first meal that we use Chef Chopski for. I have a bunch of feedback that I'm hoping to incorporate into better custom GPT instructions for Chef Chopski.

You can find Chef Chopsky's latest instructions in @chef-chopsky-custom-gpt.md . Please confirm you understand so we can get started on iterating based off my feedback.

+ # Chef Chopsky V2: Iterations After First Use
+ 
+ ## Context
+ This document initiates the second major iteration of Chef Chopsky, the custom GPT designed to help users plan, prep, and batch-cook healthy, plant-based meals—especially using CSA box ingredients. The first version of Chef Chopsky was guided by the initial instructions found in `chef-chopsky-custom-gpt.md` and informed by product documentation in the `/product` directory.
+ 
+ ## Purpose
+ The goal of this thread is to systematically improve Chef Chopsky's custom GPT instructions based on real-world feedback from the first meal-planning and cooking experience. This will ensure the assistant becomes more effective, user-friendly, and aligned with actual user needs and preferences.
+ 
+ ## Goals
+ - Capture and analyze feedback from the first use of Chef Chopsky for meal planning and prep.
+ - Identify areas where the assistant's instructions, workflow, or tone can be improved.
+ - Iterate on the custom GPT instructions to address pain points, enhance strengths, and better support the intended user experience.
+ - Document changes and rationale for future reference and continuous improvement.
+ 
+ ---
+ 
+ **Next Steps:**
+ 1. Gather and review first-use feedback.

The new prompt.md file has been created in the "v2: iterations after first use" directory. It captures the context, purpose, and goals for this next phase of work: iterating on Chef Chopsky's custom GPT instructions based on your first-use feedback.

Please share your feedback from the first meal so we can begin the process of refining and improving Chef Chopsky's instructions!

_**User**_

Okay, I'm going to dump a bunch of feedback at you. It's pretty unstructured. To start with, can you help me categorize and structure the feedback? And feel free to ask any follow-up questions to better understand certain elements of the feedback. 

What types of food do you gravitate towards. E.g. asian, spicy
I like cooking from this cookbook, or this recipe. E.g. run fast eat slow
Wanna be able to have flexibility in the meals. E.g. savory and sweet option for breakfast 
Ability to quickly heat up and eat the meal for busy work days or pack for office lunch 
Train you to feel independent as a chef, gain more experience, teach us to do it ourselves without needing you. E.g. serious eats style advice "lemon in the dish is key because of x y z"
When we started using lemon and fresh herbs, we leveled up. What else are we missing?
Suggestions within flavor profile, but also discovery / broadening suggestions 
Eat food of places where it's hot when it's hot
Ability to be directive on what I'm feeling like eating 
Incorporate pantry items
We realized we get a lot of CSA cabbage and we could turn that into kimchi... Might it suggest healthy or fun ways to make other things from scratch like yogurt 
Prefer drab to pollack
The fish and pesto don't go that well together. How could we have improved this in the way we prepared things?
Too much lemon
I don't really like plain fried fish. Cooked it too dry
Would like more focus on as fast as possible. Cooking 
Would like more unsolicited advice on how to do things efficiently. Productively optimally or like a professional chef

---

_**Assistant**_

Thank you for sharing your feedback! Here’s how I would begin to categorize and structure it, along with some clarifying questions to ensure I fully understand your needs and preferences.

---

## 1. **Flavor & Cuisine Preferences**
- What types of food do you gravitate towards? E.g. Asian, spicy
- Eat food of places where it's hot when it's hot
- Suggestions within flavor profile, but also discovery / broadening suggestions
- Ability to be directive on what I'm feeling like eating

**Questions:**
- Would you like to set default flavor/cuisine preferences, or specify them each week?
- How adventurous do you want the assistant to be in suggesting new cuisines/flavors?

---

## 2. **Recipe & Source Integration**
- I like cooking from this cookbook, or this recipe. E.g. Run Fast Eat Slow

**Questions:**
- Should the assistant prioritize recipes from your favorite cookbooks/websites?
- Would you like to upload/link recipes for the assistant to reference?

---

## 3. **Meal Flexibility & Variety**
- Wanna be able to have flexibility in the meals. E.g. savory and sweet option for breakfast
- Ability to be directive on what I'm feeling like eating

**Questions:**
- Should the assistant always offer a variety (e.g., both savory and sweet options)?
- How much variety do you want in a given week (e.g., different cuisines, meal types)?

---

## 4. **Convenience & Meal Prep**
- Ability to quickly heat up and eat the meal for busy work days or pack for office lunch
- Would like more focus on as fast as possible. Cooking

**Questions:**
- Is speed of prep or speed of reheating more important?
- Any preferred reheating methods (microwave, stovetop, etc.)?

---

## 5. **Skill-Building & Independence**
- Train you to feel independent as a chef, gain more experience, teach us to do it ourselves without needing you. E.g. Serious Eats style advice "lemon in the dish is key because of x y z"
- When we started using lemon and fresh herbs, we leveled up. What else are we missing?
- Would like more unsolicited advice on how to do things efficiently. Productively, optimally, or like a professional chef

**Questions:**
- Would you like a “pro tip” or “why this works” section in each recipe?
- How much detail do you want in skill-building advice (quick tips vs. in-depth explanations)?

---

## 6. **Ingredient Utilization & Pantry Integration**
- Incorporate pantry items
- We realized we get a lot of CSA cabbage and we could turn that into kimchi... Might it suggest healthy or fun ways to make other things from scratch like yogurt

**Questions:**
- Should the assistant always suggest ways to use up common CSA items or pantry staples?
- Are you interested in more DIY/fermentation/preservation projects?

---

## 7. **Feedback on Specific Meals**
- The fish and pesto don't go that well together. How could we have improved this in the way we prepared things?
- Too much lemon
- I don't really like plain fried fish. Cooked it too dry

**Questions:**
- Would you like the assistant to analyze past meals and suggest improvements?
- Should it track dislikes and avoid repeating them?

---

## 8. **Aesthetic Preferences**
- Prefer drab to pollack

**Questions:**
- Is this about food appearance, flavor, or something else? (Please clarify “drab to pollack”)

---

---

### Next Steps
1. Please clarify or expand on any of the above questions.
2. Let me know if there are other categories you’d like to add.
3. Once clarified, I’ll create a structured summary of your feedback to guide the next iteration of Chef Chopsky’s instructions.

Would you like to address these questions one by one, or provide additional context all at once?

_**User**_

Okay, let's focus on the recipe and source integration step. I'd like for Chef Chopski to ask me about my biggest sources of inspiration when it comes to cooking. Are there certain cookbooks, websites, or influencers that I love to follow their example in terms of things I'd like to cook? I'm hoping Chef Chopski can help identify those and remember them for me. Also, help me find new ones that are related. How should we update Chef Chopski with that in mind? 

---

_**Assistant**_

Great focus! Here’s how we can update Chef Chopsky’s custom GPT instructions to address “Recipe & Source Integration” based on your goals:

### 1. **Proactive Inspiration Intake**
- Chef Chopsky should ask early in the workflow:  
  “Are there any cookbooks, websites, or chefs/influencers you love to cook from or want to use for inspiration this week?”
- If you mention any, Chef Chopsky should:
  - Remember these sources for future weeks.
  - Offer to keep a running list of your favorites.
  - Ask if you want to prioritize recipes from these sources.

### 2. **Discovery & Suggestions**
- Chef Chopsky should occasionally suggest new sources (cookbooks, websites, influencers) that are similar to your favorites, or that match your cooking style/goals.
- Example: “You like ‘Run Fast Eat Slow’—would you like to try a recipe from ‘The First Mess’ or ‘Minimalist Baker’ this week?”

### 3. **Memory & Personalization**
- Chef Chopsky should track your preferred sources and use them to:
  - Personalize recipe suggestions.
  - Remind you of past favorites.
  - Avoid sources you dislike.

---

## **Proposed Instruction Update (for chef-chopsky-custom-gpt.md):**

**Add to the “Instructions” section, after the initial workflow questions:**

> 7. Ask about sources of inspiration:  
> “Are there any cookbooks, websites, or chefs/influencers you love to cook from or want to use for inspiration this week?”  
> - If the user mentions any, remember these sources for future weeks and offer to prioritize recipes from them.
> - Keep a running list of favorite sources and use them to personalize future suggestions.
> - Occasionally suggest new, related sources for discovery.

**Add to the “Ongoing” section:**

> - Track favorite cookbooks, websites, and influencers for recipe inspiration.
> - Suggest new sources that match the user’s preferences and cooking style.

---

### **Questions for You**
1. Would you like Chef Chopsky to ask this every week, or just occasionally?
2. Should it suggest new sources only if you ask, or proactively (e.g., “Want to try something new this week?”)?
3. Do you want to be able to “remove” a source if you stop liking it?

Let me know your preferences, and I’ll make the precise update to the instructions!

---

_**User**_

This generally sounds good. Chef Chopsky should ask about sources of inspiration definitely upon initial setup and then every now and then Chef Chopsky should check in and ask if I wanna try something new or if there are certain sources of inspiration that I no longer follow. But that should be occasional, not something that needs to be asked in every interaction. 

---

_**Assistant**_

<details><summary>Edit file: chef-chopsky-custom-gpt.md</summary>

Update the instructions to include proactive and ongoing handling of recipe inspiration sources. Chef Chopsky should ask about cookbooks, websites, or influencers as sources of inspiration during initial setup, and occasionally check in to see if you want to try new sources or remove old ones. Add this to both the workflow and ongoing memory sections.

Chef Chopsky's instructions have been updated to:

- Ask about your favorite cookbooks, websites, or influencers as sources of inspiration during initial setup.
- Remember and prioritize these sources for future meal suggestions.
- Occasionally (not every week) check in to see if you want to try new sources or remove any you no longer follow.
- Track and use your favorite sources to personalize recommendations, and suggest new, related sources over time.

This ensures Chef Chopsky will help you both remember and discover sources of inspiration, without being repetitive. If you’re ready, we can move on to the next feedback category or further refine this one!

_**User**_

Next, let's make sure that as we add new features to Chef Chopski, new things for Chef Chopski to remember. If it doesn't know these things about me, the next time I have an interaction with Chef Chopski, it should ask me to update it so that Chef Chopski has data points across all of the things supposed to remember about me. 

---

_**Assistant**_

This is a great approach for ensuring Chef Chopsky’s memory stays up-to-date and personalized as new features and data points are added. Here’s how we can update the instructions to support this:

---

## **Instruction Update: Proactive Memory Gaps**

**Add to the “Instructions” section (after listing what Chef Chopsky should remember):**

> - As new features or memory categories are added, if Chef Chopsky does not have information about the user for any of these, it should proactively ask for updates the next time the user interacts.  
> - For example, if a new “favorite cuisines” or “kitchen equipment” memory is introduced and Chef Chopsky has no data for the user, it should prompt:  
>   “I’d love to get to know your favorite cuisines! Would you like to share a few so I can personalize your meal plans?”  
> - This ensures Chef Chopsky’s memory is always complete and up-to-date across all tracked preferences, sources, and features.

**Add to the “Ongoing” section:**

> - Whenever a new memory category or feature is introduced, check if there is missing information for the user. If so, ask the user to provide or update this information in a friendly, non-intrusive way.

---

### **Proposed Instruction Text**

**Instructions section (after memory list):**
```
- As new features or memory categories are added, if Chef Chopsky does not have information about you for any of these, it should ask you to update it the next time you interact. This keeps your preferences and data points current, and ensures you get the best recommendations.
```

**Ongoing section:**
```
- Whenever a new thing to remember is introduced (e.g., favorite cuisines, kitchen equipment, dietary goals), check if this information is missing. If so, ask the user for it in a friendly, non-intrusive way.
```

---

Would you like to use this wording, or do you want it to be more/less proactive or more specific in tone? If you approve, I’ll update the instructions accordingly.

The instructions in chef-chopsky-custom-gpt.md have been updated so that Chef Chopsky will now:

- Ensure all relevant data points about you are collected and up-to-date, prompting you in a friendly, non-intrusive way if anything is missing.

This will help keep Chef Chopsky’s recommendations and personalization as effective as possible as new features are introduced. Let me know which feedback category you’d like to tackle next, or if you want to further refine this update!

---

_**User**_

Okay, let's work on the flavor and cuisine preferences to do next in @prompt.md.

I'd like for chef Chopski to have a general understanding of the types of food that my partner and I gravitate towards. For example, we eat a lot of Asian food, a lot of spicy food, etc.

Also, I'd like for chef Chopski to learn those things about me over time and continually update its memory so that it has a decent understanding of the styles and types of food that we prefer to eat.

How would you recommend we work that into chef Chopski? 

---

_**Assistant**_

Here’s a recommended approach for integrating “Flavor & Cuisine Preferences” into Chef Chopsky’s workflow and memory, based on your goals:

---

## 1. **Initial Setup: Ask About Preferences**
- On first use (or when this feature is introduced), Chef Chopsky should ask:
  > “Are there certain cuisines or flavor profiles you and your partner especially enjoy? (e.g., Asian, spicy, Mediterranean, comfort food, etc.)”
- Allow you to list as many as you want, and optionally rank or “star” favorites.

## 2. **Ongoing Learning: Adaptive Memory**
- As you interact, Chef Chopsky should:
  - Notice when you choose or praise certain cuisines/flavors (“We loved the spicy tofu!”).
  - Occasionally confirm or update its understanding (“I’ve noticed you enjoy spicy and Asian-inspired meals. Is that still true, or are you craving something different lately?”).
  - Prompt for new preferences if you try something new or if your tastes seem to shift.

## 3. **Personalization & Discovery**
- Use your stated and learned preferences to:
  - Prioritize meal suggestions that match your favorite cuisines/flavors.
  - Occasionally suggest something adjacent for gentle discovery (“You like Thai food—would you like to try a Vietnamese-inspired dish this week?”).
  - Avoid suggesting cuisines/flavors you’ve disliked or said to avoid.

## 4. **Memory Management**
- Keep a running, editable list of your preferred cuisines/flavors.
- Allow you to add/remove/update preferences at any time (“We’re really into Mediterranean food lately—can you add that to our list?”).

---

### **Proposed Instruction Update for chef-chopsky-custom-gpt.md**

**Add to the “Instructions” section:**
> - On initial setup, ask: “Are there certain cuisines or flavor profiles you and your partner especially enjoy? (e.g., Asian, spicy, Mediterranean, etc.)”  
> - Remember these preferences and use them to personalize meal suggestions.
> - As you interact, learn from feedback and choices to update your understanding of the user’s favorite cuisines and flavors.
> - Occasionally check in to confirm or update these preferences, especially if new patterns emerge or if the user’s tastes seem to change.
> - Use these preferences to prioritize suggestions, but also offer gentle discovery of related cuisines/flavors.

**Add to the “Ongoing” section:**
> - Track and update the user’s preferred cuisines and flavor profiles over time.
> - Use memory to avoid suggesting disliked cuisines/flavors and to encourage variety within the user’s comfort zone.

---

### **Questions for You**
1. Would you like Chef Chopsky to ask about flavor/cuisine preferences for both you and your partner separately, or as a household?
2. How often should it check in to update these preferences (e.g., monthly, after a few new meals, only when it detects a change)?
3. Do you want the option to “ban” certain cuisines/flavors entirely?

Let me know your preferences, and I’ll draft the exact update for the instructions and mark this to-do as complete in prompt.md!

---

_**User**_

Chef Chopski should generally keep track of:
- My preferences
- My partner's preferences (it's not that important, so let's have Chef Chopski check in on these every other month or so)
- My household preferences
Let's also have Chef Chopski ask if there are any specific dietary constraints Chef Chopski should be working around.

With that in mind, let's go ahead and make these changes and any other changes you'd suggest to Chef Chopsky @chef-chopsky-custom-gpt.md 

---

_**Assistant**_

<details><summary>Edit file: chef-chopsky-custom-gpt.md</summary>

- Ask about any specific dietary constraints (allergies, intolerances, religious, etc.).
- Learn and update these preferences over time, using feedback and choices.

- Use these preferences to personalize meal suggestions, avoid disliked cuisines/flavors, and gently introduce related new options.
- Track and respect dietary constraints.
- Continue to proactively fill in any missing data points as new features are added.

_**User**_

Another important factor to capture in Chef Chopsky's instructions is the user's willingness to explore and discover new foods or styles or preferences. Could you help me create some sort of preference for adventurousness within Chef Chopsky's recommendations? How would you implement that? 

---

_**Assistant**_

Absolutely! Capturing a user’s “adventurousness” or openness to discovery is a powerful way to personalize recommendations and control the balance between comfort and novelty. Here’s how I’d recommend implementing this in Chef Chopsky’s instructions:

---

## 1. **Initial Setup: Ask About Adventurousness**
On first use (or when this feature is introduced), Chef Chopsky should ask:
> “How adventurous do you want to be with your meals?  
> - Do you prefer sticking mostly to familiar favorites,  
> - a mix of comfort and new things,  
> - or are you excited to try new cuisines, ingredients, and techniques?”

You could offer a simple scale, for example:
- 1 = Stick to what I know
- 2 = Mostly familiar, occasional new things
- 3 = Mix of both
- 4 = Frequently try new things
- 5 = Surprise me, I love discovery!

## 2. **Ongoing: Adaptive Discovery**
- Chef Chopsky should use this “adventurousness” setting to:
  - Adjust how often it suggests new cuisines, ingredients, or techniques.
  - Tailor the “discovery” nudges (e.g., “Want to try a new spice blend this week?”).
  - Respect boundaries—if you’re low on adventurousness, rarely suggest big changes.
- Over time, Chef Chopsky can check in:  
  “Would you like to try something a little more adventurous this week, or stick to your favorites?”

## 3. **Memory & Personalization**
- Remember your adventurousness preference and allow you to update it at any time.
- Optionally, let you set different adventurousness levels for yourself, your partner, or your household.

Let's tackle the next two items in tandem, as I think they both relate to food prep: Meal Flexibility & Variety and Convenience & Meal Prep in @prompt.md .

The core insight behind each of these buckets of feedback is the user would like the ability to be somewhat directive to Chef Chopsky in some of the parameters related to food prep that Chef Chopsky should keep in mind when making its recommendation. For example, when Chef Chopsky recommends food prep for all of our lunches for the week, we may want to be able to tell Chef Chopsky "we want two options for lunch, one savoury and one sweet option". We also may not want to be directed with Chef Chopsky every time, we might want Chef Chopsky to ask and suggest that we have two different options. With that in mind, can you help suggest updates to the prompt that would address that particular piece of feedback? 

---

_**Assistant**_

Absolutely! Here’s how I’d recommend updating Chef Chopsky’s instructions to address both “Meal Flexibility & Variety” and “Convenience & Meal Prep,” focusing on user-directiveness and smart, proactive suggestions:

---

## 1. **User-Directed Flexibility**
- Allow the user to specify preferences for meal variety and prep style each week (e.g., “We want two lunch options: one savory, one sweet” or “We want all lunches to be the same for simplicity”).
- Make it easy for the user to be as specific or as hands-off as they want.

## 2. **Proactive, Contextual Suggestions**
- If the user doesn’t specify, Chef Chopsky should occasionally suggest options for variety or convenience, such as:
  - “Would you like to have two different lunch options this week, or keep it simple with just one?”
  - “Would you prefer meals that are quick to reheat and easy to pack for work?”
- Chef Chopsky should remember past preferences and offer to repeat or tweak them (“Last week you had a savory and a sweet lunch—want to do that again?”).

## 3. **Convenience & Prep Parameters**
- Allow the user to specify convenience-related parameters, such as:
  - “Meals should be quick to reheat.”
  - “Meals should be easy to pack for the office.”
  - “We want to minimize prep time.”
- If not specified, Chef Chopsky should default to suggesting efficient, batch-friendly, and office-friendly options, but check in occasionally to see if the user wants to adjust.

---

### **Proposed Instruction Update for chef-chopsky-custom-gpt.md**

**Add to the “Instructions” section:**
> - Ask if the user has preferences for meal variety and prep style each week (e.g., “Would you like multiple lunch options, such as one savory and one sweet, or keep all lunches the same?”).
> - Allow the user to specify convenience parameters (e.g., “quick to reheat,” “easy to pack for work,” “minimal prep time”).
> - If the user does not specify, occasionally suggest options for variety and convenience, and remember past choices to offer relevant suggestions in the future.
> - Make it easy for the user to be as specific or as hands-off as they want—adapt to their level of directiveness.

**Add to the “Ongoing” section:**
> - Track and remember user preferences for meal variety, flexibility, and convenience.
> - Use memory to offer to repeat or tweak past successful approaches (e.g., “Want to do the savory/sweet split again?”).
> - Occasionally check in to see if the user wants to adjust their approach to variety or convenience.

Would you like Chef Chopsky to always ask about variety/convenience, or only sometimes (e.g., every few weeks or when it detects a pattern change)? And do you want it to suggest “savory/sweet” as a default, or just as one of several options? Let me know your preferences and I’ll draft the exact update for the instructions!

Chef Chopski doesn't need to always ask about variety or convenience or the fact that multiple options are possible.

Great, next up is the skill building and independence to do in @prompt.md .

Part of ChefChopsky's goal should be to help the user become as independent and experienced as possible when it comes to cooking meals for themselves. So the goal is for the user to learn how to do things like what ChefChopsky is recommending on their own over time.

For example, one thing we learned was that we should always buy fresh lemons from the grocery store because adding a little bit of lemon zest or lemon juice helps brighten up a dish. Similarly, we started buying fresh herbs from the grocery store because we realized herbs are another nice way to level up a dish.

As a user, I would really like a lot more unsolicited advice on how to be an expert chef - either do things more efficiently, productively, optimally, or generally like a professional chef. I'm super curious about the pro tips that I'm missing and also why are certain components of the recipe recommended? Like, why are those important and how do they work? I'm even curious to get really detailed feedback such as the optimal way to cut an onion for example.

With all of this in mind, how would you update ChefChopsky to address this feedback? 

---

_**Assistant**_

This is a fantastic direction for Chef Chopsky! Here’s how I would update the instructions to foster skill-building, independence, and a “pro chef” mindset:

---

## 1. **Proactive Skill-Building & Teaching**
- Chef Chopsky should proactively offer “pro tips” and expert advice, even if not explicitly asked.
- For each recipe or prep step, include:
  - **Why** a technique or ingredient is recommended (e.g., “Lemon zest brightens flavors because…”).
  - Suggestions for “leveling up” (e.g., “Try adding fresh herbs for more aroma and color.”).
  - Occasional “Did you know?” or “Pro tip” callouts for efficiency, technique, or flavor.

## 2. **Encourage Independence**
- Remind the user that the goal is to help them become more independent and confident in the kitchen.
- Offer to teach foundational skills (e.g., “Want to learn the optimal way to cut an onion for soup?”).
- Suggest skill-building quests or challenges (e.g., “Master the Sheet Pan!”).

## 3. **Feedback & Curiosity**
- Invite the user to ask “why” about any step or ingredient.
- Proactively explain the reasoning behind recommendations, especially for less obvious steps or ingredients.
- Encourage curiosity and experimentation (“Try swapping in a different herb and see how it changes the dish!”).

## 4. **Memory & Personalization**
- Track which pro tips, techniques, or skills the user has learned or shown interest in.
- Avoid repeating basic tips the user already knows, and offer more advanced advice as they progress.

I don't always need Chef Chopsky to include a "Why this works" or pro tips section.

Great, let's move on to number 6. Ingredient Utilization & Pantry Integration.

The root user need behind this group of feedback is that the user wants to learn and explore more ways to batch cook or prep things for their kitchen. For example, making kimchi has been a huge life hack for us because we have received a lot of cabbage. We've gotten good at making kimchi, and it helps us always have vegetables on hand whenever we need to add vegetables to a meal. We're also super curious whether there are other types of things that are relatively easy to make from scratch at home and in bulk that would generally be more nutritious for us than things that are store-bought. One specific example we're curious about is yogurt. These are just examples though. How would you kind of generalize these examples into an updated prompt that addresses the general concept or desire to learn more things we can do to eat healthier with minimal food prep. 

---

_**Assistant**_

This is a great opportunity to make Chef Chopsky even more valuable as a kitchen coach and batch-cooking mentor! Here’s how I would generalize and update the instructions to address this need:

---

## 1. **Proactive Batch Cooking & DIY Suggestions**
- Chef Chopsky should proactively suggest creative, nutritious, and easy-to-batch-prep ideas for using up common CSA or pantry items (e.g., “You have a lot of cabbage—want to try making kimchi, sauerkraut, or a big batch of slaw?”).
- When a surplus or recurring ingredient is detected, offer ideas for preservation, fermentation, or bulk prep (e.g., kimchi, pickles, yogurt, granola, nut butters, etc.).

## 2. **Teach Simple, Nutritious DIY Staples**
- Occasionally suggest or teach how to make healthy staples from scratch that are often store-bought, especially if they’re easy, cost-effective, or more nutritious (e.g., yogurt, hummus, nut milk, overnight oats, etc.).
- Explain the benefits of making these at home (nutrition, cost, flavor, customization).

## 3. **Encourage Exploration & Skill-Building**
- Encourage the user to try new batch-cooking or DIY projects, but don’t overwhelm—offer these as optional “want to try something new?” nudges.
- Track which projects the user has tried or shown interest in, and suggest new ones over time.

## 4. **Personalization & Memory**
- Remember which DIY/batch projects the user has enjoyed or prefers, and offer to repeat or build on them.
- Avoid suggesting projects the user has tried and disliked, or that don’t fit their dietary needs.

Chef Chopski doesn't need to always suggest DIY batch projects; it's something that should come up organically.

There's a lot of different types of feedback we might give on a meal. The goal is for Chef Chopski to be continually learning from what it recommends, what we do, and our feedback on what it recommends to improve its recommendations in the future.

With that in mind, how would you update Chef Chopsky? 

---

_**Assistant**_

This is a powerful way to make Chef Chopsky truly adaptive and personalized! Here’s how I would update the instructions to address feedback on specific meals—including aesthetic, flavor, and logistical feedback—and ensure Chef Chopsky learns and improves over time:

---

## 1. **Track and Prompt for Feedback on All Recommended Meals**
- After recommending meals, Chef Chopsky should remember each one and, after a reasonable time, check in to ask if you made it and what you thought.
- Feedback should be open-ended but can be prompted with categories:  
  - “How did you like the meal?”  
  - “Was there anything about the flavor, appearance, or prep process you’d change?”  
  - “Was it easy, affordable, and enjoyable to make?”

## 2. **Categorize and Remember Feedback**
- Chef Chopsky should categorize feedback as:
  - Aesthetic (appearance, plating, visual appeal)
  - Flavor (taste, seasoning, balance, etc.)
  - Logistical (prep time, difficulty, cost, ingredient availability, etc.)
  - Other (any additional notes)
- All feedback should be tied to the specific meal and used to update memory.

## 3. **Use Feedback to Improve Future Recommendations**
- Chef Chopsky should use your feedback to:
  - Avoid repeating disliked elements (e.g., “You mentioned you didn’t like the texture of last week’s stew, so I’ll suggest something different this time.”)
  - Double down on what you loved (e.g., “You loved the colorful sheet pan meal—here’s another vibrant, easy-prep option!”)
  - Adjust for logistical needs (e.g., “Last week’s meal took too long, so here’s a quicker option.”)
  - Refine aesthetic recommendations (e.g., “You prefer drab, rustic plating—let’s keep it simple this week.”)

## 4. **Continual Learning and Personalization**
- Over time, Chef Chopsky should learn your evolving preferences and feedback patterns, making each recommendation more tailored.
- Allow you to review or update past feedback if your opinion changes.

---

### **Proposed Instruction Update for chef-chopsky-custom-gpt.md**

**Add to the “Instructions” section:**
> - After recommending meals, remember each one and check in with the user after a reasonable time to ask if they made it and what they thought.
> - Prompt for feedback in multiple areas, such as flavor, appearance, prep time, cost, and overall enjoyment.
> - Categorize and remember feedback for each meal, including aesthetic, flavor, logistical, and other notes.
> - Use this feedback to improve future recommendations, avoiding disliked elements and emphasizing what the user enjoys.
> - Continually learn from user feedback to make each recommendation more personalized and aligned with their evolving preferences.

**Add to the “Ongoing” section:**
> - Track all recommended meals and user feedback on each.
> - Use feedback to refine future suggestions, including aesthetic, flavor, and logistical improvements.
> - Allow the user to review or update past feedback as needed.

---

Would you like Chef Chopsky to always prompt for feedback after every meal, or just occasionally? And do you want it to summarize your feedback history for you, or just use it behind the scenes? Let me know your preferences and I’ll draft the exact update for the instructions!

---

_**User**_

Chef Chopsky probably should ask for feedback in each new Interaction after it suggests a meal. When that feedback is provided, it should largely use that feedback behind the scenes, but it should confirm with the user: "Hey, I've heard your feedback and I've understood X, Y, and Z about it. I will incorporate this feedback into future recommendations."

_**Assistant**_

<details><summary>Edit file: chef-chopsky-custom-gpt.md</summary>

Update instructions so Chef Chopsky prompts for feedback after each meal suggestion, uses feedback behind the scenes, and confirms with the user what it learned and how it will use the feedback. Ensure feedback can cover aesthetic, flavor, and logistical aspects, and is used to improve future recommendations.

Chef Chopsky’s instructions have been updated so that:

- After each meal suggestion, Chef Chopsky will prompt for feedback in the next interaction, asking if you made the meal and what you thought of it.
- Feedback can cover flavor, appearance, prep time, cost, and overall enjoyment, and is categorized and remembered for each meal.
- Chef Chopsky will use this feedback primarily behind the scenes to improve future recommendations, but will always confirm with you what it learned and how it will use your feedback (e.g., “Hey, I’ve heard your feedback and I’ve understood X, Y, and Z about it. I will incorporate this feedback into future recommendations.”).
- You can review or update past feedback as needed.

This ensures Chef Chopsky is continually learning and adapting to your preferences, making each recommendation more personalized and relevant. Let me know if you’d like to further refine this or move on to the next area!

_**User**_

Great, I think we've processed all of the specific feedback that we had in mind. Now let's take a step back, looking at a high level at Chef Chopsky's instructions and comparing that to our aspirations for Chef Chopsky as a product, what are some more higher level suggestions or foundational changes that you might make to Chef Chopsky's instructions? 

---

_**Assistant**_

Fantastic work iterating through all the detailed feedback! Now, stepping back and looking at Chef Chopsky’s instructions as a whole—especially in light of your aspirations for the product—here are some higher-level, foundational suggestions to consider for further elevating Chef Chopsky:

---

## 1. **Unify the “Coach” and “Companion” Voice**
- **Aspirational Goal:** Chef Chopsky isn’t just a meal planner—it’s a smart, encouraging, and sometimes witty kitchen companion that helps you grow as a cook.
- **Suggestion:**  
  - Make sure the instructions consistently reinforce a warm, encouraging, and slightly witty “coach” persona throughout all interactions, not just in the “Style” section.
  - Consider adding explicit reminders to use positive reinforcement, celebrate user progress (“You nailed batch cooking this week!”), and inject moments of delight.

## 2. **Explicitly Support Habit Formation**
- **Aspirational Goal:** Chef Chopsky should help users build sustainable, healthy cooking habits.
- **Suggestion:**  
  - Add instructions for Chef Chopsky to recognize and reinforce streaks, milestones, or improvements (e.g., “That’s your third week in a row prepping lunches—awesome consistency!”).
  - Occasionally suggest small, achievable “next steps” or “mini-challenges” to keep users engaged and improving.

## 3. **Make Learning and Growth a Core Loop**
- **Aspirational Goal:** Users should feel like they’re getting better at cooking, not just getting recipes.
- **Suggestion:**  
  - Add a “learning loop” where Chef Chopsky occasionally summarizes what you’ve learned or improved (“You’ve mastered kimchi and knife skills—want to try a new technique next week?”).
  - Encourage reflection: “What’s one thing you’d like to get better at in the kitchen?”

## 4. **Personalization as a Living System**
- **Aspirational Goal:** Chef Chopsky should feel more personalized and “alive” over time.
- **Suggestion:**  
  - Make it clear that Chef Chopsky’s memory is dynamic—remind users that they can update, reset, or review their preferences and feedback at any time.
  - Occasionally surface a “memory check” (“Here’s what I know about your preferences—anything you want to update?”).

## 5. **Proactive Problem-Solving**
- **Aspirational Goal:** Chef Chopsky should anticipate and help solve common kitchen problems.
- **Suggestion:**  
  - Add instructions for Chef Chopsky to proactively offer solutions to common pain points (e.g., “Noticed you’re short on time this week—want a 30-minute meal plan?” or “Running low on fresh produce? Here are pantry-based ideas.”).

## 6. **Seamless Integration of Feedback and Iteration**
- **Aspirational Goal:** Chef Chopsky should feel like it’s always getting smarter with you.
- **Suggestion:**  
  - Occasionally summarize how it’s changed its recommendations based on your feedback (“I’ve stopped suggesting X since you mentioned you didn’t love it, and I’m focusing more on Y because you enjoyed it.”).
  - Make the learning process transparent and collaborative.

## 7. **Future-Proofing for Integrations and Expansions**
- **Aspirational Goal:** Chef Chopsky will eventually connect to more data sources (CSA APIs, grocery delivery, health trackers).
- **Suggestion:**  
  - Add a placeholder in the instructions for “integration awareness”—Chef Chopsky should be ready to ask about or use new data sources as they become available, and explain how they’ll improve the experience.

---

### **How to Implement These?**
- Consider adding a “Core Philosophy” or “Guiding Principles” section at the top of the instructions, summarizing the above.
- Sprinkle reminders throughout the workflow and ongoing sections to reinforce these foundational behaviors.
- Make sure the “Style” section is not just about tone, but about the overall user experience and relationship.

Would you like to see a draft of a “Core Philosophy” section, or specific examples of how to weave these principles into the existing instructions? Or do you want to focus on any of these high-level areas in more depth?

Here is a first draft of Chef Chopsky’s instructions, fully updated to reflect all your detailed and high-level feedback. This version includes a new “Core Philosophy” section, integrates habit-building, learning loops, proactive coaching, dynamic memory, and future-proofing, and weaves the “coach/companion” persona throughout. The workflow, ongoing, and style sections are unified and user-centric, ensuring Chef Chopsky is both a powerful assistant and a delightful, growth-oriented kitchen companion.

If you’d like to further refine any section, add more examples, or adjust the tone, just let me know!

---

_**User**_

Okay. I've taken your suggestions and accepted some and rejected some, because I was a little bit confused. Can you take another look at the chef Chopsky instructions and generally make some recommendations to clean it up a bit and explain the thought process behind each of your changes, please? 

---

_**Assistant**_

Absolutely! I’ll review your current chef-chopsky-custom-gpt.md, identify areas for cleanup, and explain the reasoning behind each recommended change. Here’s how I’ll approach it:

---

## 1. **Section Structure & Redundancy**
**Observation:**  
- There are now two “philosophy”/“guiding principles” sections: one at the top and one under “Instructions.”
- The “Ongoing” section is duplicated: once as a standalone section, and again as a bulleted list after the workflow.
- Some lists (e.g., feedback tracking, memory) are repeated in both the workflow and ongoing sections.

**Recommendation:**  
- Consolidate the “Core Philosophy” into a single, clear section at the top.
- Keep “Instructions” focused on the weekly workflow and core logic.
- Move all memory, feedback, and learning loop items to a single, well-organized “Ongoing” section.
- Remove duplicate or redundant lines.

**Reasoning:**  
This makes the document easier to read, reduces confusion, and ensures each section has a clear purpose.

---

## 2. **Numbering and Flow**
**Observation:**  
- The workflow steps are numbered, but then “Then: 14. Recommend 1–3 batch-cookable lunch meals…” breaks the flow.
- Some steps are out of logical order (e.g., “Ingredient Utilization & Pantry Integration” comes after “Include a structured plan”).

**Recommendation:**  
- Use clear, sequential numbering for the main workflow.
- Move “Ingredient Utilization & Pantry Integration” and “Feedback on Specific Meals” to the “Ongoing” section, as they are continuous processes rather than weekly steps.
- Keep the workflow focused on the user’s experience from start to finish.

**Reasoning:**  
A logical, sequential workflow is easier for both users and future editors to follow.

---

## 3. **Clarity and Conciseness**
**Observation:**  
- Some bullet points are verbose or repeat the same idea in different words.
- Some “guiding principles” are stated in both the philosophy and style sections.

**Recommendation:**  
- Edit for clarity and brevity, combining similar points.
- Keep “Style” focused on tone and user experience, and “Philosophy” on the product’s purpose and values.

**Reasoning:**  
Concise instructions are easier to maintain and less likely to be misinterpreted.

---

## 4. **Explicit User Empowerment**
**Observation:**  
- The instructions mention that users can update preferences, but this is not always explicit.

**Recommendation:**  
- Add a line in the “Ongoing” section: “Remind users they can review or update their preferences, feedback, and memory at any time.”

**Reasoning:**  
This empowers users and makes the assistant feel more transparent and collaborative.

---

## 5. **Future-Proofing**
**Observation:**  
- The “integration”/“future data sources” point is a bit buried.

**Recommendation:**  
- Add a clear bullet in “Ongoing” or “Philosophy” about readiness for new integrations and how they’ll be surfaced to the user.

**Reasoning:**  
This keeps the product vision clear and prepares for future expansion.

---

## 6. **Example of a Cleaned-Up Structure**
Here’s a suggested outline (not the full text, just the structure):

1. **Core Philosophy** (purpose, guiding principles, product vision)
2. **Instructions** (weekly workflow, step-by-step, concise)
3. **Ongoing** (memory, feedback, learning, user empowerment, future-proofing)
4. **Style** (tone, voice, user experience)
5. **Conversation Starters**
6. **Settings**

---

Would you like me to go ahead and implement these cleanups directly in chef-chopsky-custom-gpt.md, or would you like to review a proposed outline or sample section first?
