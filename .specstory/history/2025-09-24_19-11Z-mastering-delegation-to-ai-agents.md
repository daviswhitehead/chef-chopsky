# Mastering delegation to AI agents (2025-09-24 19:11Z)

_**User (2025-09-23 21:19Z)**_

One of the superpowers of AI‑driven development, Cursor, and other products that offer background agents is that these agents can write code for you and do work while you sleep. I’d like to get really good at delegating many tasks to multiple agents at once, having them work in parallel, and stepping into a role where I manage a bunch of agents, review their work, approve it, or give feedback to iterate. Given what you know about Chef Chopsky and the goals I’ve described, can you help me figure out how to get started, how to get good at this, and what sorts of things I should ask agents to do on my behalf?

_**Assistant (default)**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Guiding project management for Chef Chopsky**

I need to provide guidance on how to manage multiple agents and delegate tasks for the Chef Chopsky project. The user prefers a high-level plan before getting into implementation details.

I'll outline actionable steps and task categories to delegate. This will include workflows for Cursor, CI agents, and LangGraph, considering their preference for E2E Playwright and avoiding auto-running dev servers. Although no code changes were requested, I can propose educational next steps and sample prompts while keeping it organized and minimal.
**Structuring task categories for Chef Chopsky**

I need to create specific categories for tasks such as product discovery, feature development, test authoring, documentation, CI maintenance, telemetry, data labeling, and customer support macros. I'll propose a method to run parallel jobs using Cursor agents by utilizing "Tasks" to trigger multiple agents with clear context and constraints.

I should provide templates for prompts and outline an operating cadence that includes morning reviews, nightly batches, triage, approvals, and measurable KPIs. Additionally, I’ll suggest tailored tasks for agents, like recipe recommendations and E2E tests, along with an initial plan for the first week.
**Proposing a Notion setup and status updates**

I’ll suggest a Notion setup, even though tools exist. It’s important to include a status update, as the framework indicates these are necessary when using tools—though optional when none are used. Since we aren't employing any tools, I can include a brief progress note.

At the end of my response, I’ll also provide a summary. I’ll structure it with headings and concise bullet points, including templates like "Agent task template," "Parallelization playbook," and "Review checklist," ensuring everything remains clear and manageable without getting too lengthy.</details></think>

### Big picture
You’ll get the most leverage by turning yourself into a “product/editor-in-chief” who:
- Defines clear briefs with constraints and a definition of done.
- Spawns multiple agents in parallel against small, independent, shippable tasks.
- Reviews outputs quickly with checklists, auto-evals, and CI gates.
- Iterates via short feedback loops and data from tests/telemetry.

Below is a concise playbook tailored to Chef Chopsky and your stack.

### How to get started (this week)
- Launchpad
  - Set up agent work surfaces: one backlog per area (frontend, agent, tests, docs). Keep tasks ≤ 1–3 hours each.
  - Create a single “Agent DoD” doc (shared snippet) that every task inherits.
- Parallelize with structure
  - Batch 4–8 tasks/night that don’t block each other. Keep hard dependencies out of the same batch.
  - For each task: include purpose, context links, constraints (TypeScript, RN + RNW, NativeWind + gluestack, Supabase), acceptance tests, artifacts to produce, and a timebox.
- Tight review loop
  - Require: CI green, Playwright E2E added/updated, lint/types clean, small PRs.
  - Skim diffs, run a quick local smoke, request one revision max, merge or archive.
- Close the loop with telemetry
  - Log basic agent metrics (task time, retries, failures), test pass rates, and user-facing outcomes. Use this to refine brief templates and task shapes.

### What to delegate to agents (high‑leverage categories)
- Frontend (Next.js + RN + RNW)
  - Small UI components using `gluestack` + `NativeWind`.
  - Page scaffolding under `frontend/app/…` (list/detail pages, forms).
  - Accessibility passes (labels/roles), error/empty states, loading skeletons.
- Agent/AI system (LangGraph + LangChain)
  - Node/refactor tasks in `agent/src/retrieval_graph/…` (e.g., tool wiring, retries).
  - Evaluation harnesses (LangSmith traces/evals) for key flows.
  - Prompt/compiler cleanups with clear diffs + tests.
- Testing (E2E‑first with Playwright)
  - Add/repair tests for each new feature, stabilize flaky selectors, seed minimal test data.
  - Smoke checks for core flows (conversation start/send/feedback) against local env.
- CI/CD + DevEx
  - Improve/fix GitHub Actions (your auto‑fix flows), add caching, speed-ups.
  - Static checks (eslint, tsc), PR templates, preview env checks.
- Documentation
  - Update `/docs` and in‑repo READMEs after code changes; short “how to run, test, debug” sections.
- Analytics/feedback
  - Add instrumented events, wire feedback tables/queries, generate weekly digest from logs.

### What to ask for (task template you can paste)
```md
Task: [short verb-led title]
Context: [links to code dirs/files, product doc, screenshots]
Goal: [user outcome + measurable acceptance]
Constraints:
- TypeScript everywhere; RN + RNW shared components; gluestack + NativeWind.
- Supabase DB; Playwright E2E; no web-only libs in shared code.
Definition of Done:
- Code + tests + docs updated.
- Lint/types clean; Playwright passing in headless; CI config untouched unless requested.
- Small PR with clear description and screenshots or recordings if user-facing.
Artifacts:
- PR title/description
- Test names/paths changed
- Before/after screenshots (if UI)
Timebox: [e.g., 90 minutes]
```

### Parallelization playbook
- Split by seams, not layers:
  - One agent updates UI component; another writes E2E; another updates docs; another refactors an agent node. They don’t step on each other.
- Prefer “clone and converge” on risky items:
  - Assign 2 agents the same small prompt or tool integration; pick the best; discard the rest.
- Cap batch size:
  - 4–8 tasks/night is ideal; more increases review fatigue and conflicts.

### Review checklist (fast)
- Lint/types: zero errors.
- Tests: new/updated Playwright tests for changes; pass headless.
- Cross-platform: no DOM-only APIs in shared RN code.
- A11y: labels/roles present for interactive UI.
- Size: PR ≤ ~300 lines changed unless necessary; good description; screenshots.

### Chef Chopsky: agent‑friendly tasks you can dispatch today
- Frontend
  - Create reusable `MessageBubble`, `TypingIndicator`, and `Toast` with `gluestack` + `NativeWind`.
  - Add “Run again with tweak” control in the chat UI (reruns last request with 1 param change).
  - Add optimistic UI for sending messages; handle streaming and error fallback.
- E2E
  - Stabilize selectors in `frontend/tests/e2e/**`.
  - Add tests: “start conversation”, “send message”, “submit feedback”, “view stats”.
- Agent (LangGraph)
  - Add tool node for retrieving dietary defaults; cache recent pantry items; add retry/backoff.
  - Implement guardrail: refuse unsafe instructions; test branches for “refuse vs comply.”
- Observability
  - Add LangSmith tracing for key nodes; create a minimal eval comparing two prompts.
- CI
  - Optimize GitHub workflow caching; add a quick `pnpm/npm ci` cache; fail fast on lint/types.

### Operating cadence
- Nightly: dispatch batch, sleep.
- Morning: review in 30–60 minutes total; merge the good; 1 feedback round for the rest; archive dead ends.
- Weekly: look at metrics (PR time-to-merge, test flake rate, eval scores); adjust task sizing and templates.

### Short prompts you’ll reuse
- “Write the Playwright E2E for the feature that just shipped. Use stable role-based selectors, headless, and make it fast. Add it under `frontend/tests/e2e/feature-name.spec.ts`. Definition of done: test passes locally, runs on CI, and is resilient to minor UI changes.”
- “Refactor the LangGraph node at `agent/src/retrieval_graph/<file>.ts` to add retries with exponential backoff and structured errors. Keep function signatures stable. Add unit-level tests if meaningful, otherwise cover via E2E.”
- “Create a `gluestack` + `NativeWind` component that works in RN and RNW: [component name]. Include a11y props, keyboard interactions, and story-like usage snippet in the PR description.”

### How to get good at this (quickly)
- Limit scope ruthlessly; agents excel at “tight, small, well-specified” work.
- Make acceptance tests explicit up front; agents produce what you measure.
- Prefer PRs that are easy to review over perfect solutions.
- Keep a “best prompts” snippets doc and evolve it weekly.
- Track 3 KPIs: merged-per-day, rework rate (requested changes), and test stability.

### Starter batch (copy/paste to your backlog)
- Add `TypingIndicator` and `MessageBubble` components with a11y and tests.
- Add Playwright tests: conversation start/send/feedback pass reliably.
- Instrument LangSmith tracing for `server-langchain` happy path.
- Introduce retry/backoff in one LangGraph node with structured error handling.
- Improve CI caching in auto-fix workflow; cap total minutes.

—  
- I can prepare the first 5 task briefs (with file paths, acceptance tests, and artifacts) if you want me to draft them now.
- If you’d like, I can also propose a minimal evaluation plan (LangSmith) for the core recommendation flow and add the E2E test list. 

- Summary:
  - Provided a concrete delegation playbook, task template, and review checklist tailored to Chef Chopsky’s stack (TypeScript, RN+RNW, gluestack + NativeWind, Supabase, Playwright).
  - Listed parallelizable, agent-friendly tasks you can dispatch immediately across frontend, agent graph, tests, CI, and docs.
  - Included reusable prompts and a weekly operating cadence to scale parallel agent work safely.

_**User (2025-09-23 21:19Z)**_

Can you create a new project for this in the documentation projects folder? Go ahead and take what we've talked about thus far and start documenting a plan doc. Feel free to ask additional questions of me if you need. And then I'd like your help testing out a few different potential tasks to get started with.

---

_**Assistant (default)**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Planning project documentation**

I need to create a new project documentation folder and a plan document. The user wants to document a plan based on earlier advice, so I’ll set up a folder named something like v5: agent-parallelization-playbook. I’ll also create a tasks.md file with initial briefs. Since the user mentioned including 3-5 initial tasks in the plan doc, I’ll do that and suggest testing steps. I should keep everything concise and provide status updates along the way. Let's get started!
**Creating project files**

I'm going to create the necessary files, naming the plan as v5: parallel-agent-delegation/plan.md located under the documentation/projects path. I'll ensure the filesystem path is correct, and I'll use apply_patch to create this file directly. 

In the plan, I'll use proper markdown format with headings and a questions section included. I’ll also propose three initial tasks with briefs and mention next steps without needing to run lints afterward. Before and after, I’ll update the to-dos using todo_write and mark our progress. Let’s make this happen!</details></think>

---

I'll create a new project folder in `documentation/projects/` and add a concise plan doc with initial parallel-agent workflows, task templates, and a starter batch of tasks. Then I'll propose a few specific test tasks we can try immediately.

Tool use: **todo_write**

## Todo List

- [-] Create new documentation project folder for agent parallelization
- [ ] Draft plan doc capturing delegation playbook and processes
- [ ] Outline 3-5 starter agent task briefs for immediate testing
- [ ] Collect open questions/assumptions for user clarification

---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Planning documentation structure**

I need to create new documentation under the projects folder. I'll be using the `edit_file/apply_patch` method to add a new folder and a markdown file with a project plan. It's important to follow the existing code style while keeping in mind this is documentation. I'll include status updates before tool calls and propose starter tasks and questions within the document. My goal is to set up a clean structure with clear content, like a plan and task templates.
**Setting up task documentation**

The user wants help testing various tasks, so I'll create a separate file named `tasks.md` to include 3-5 task briefs. Along with that, I'll also set up `plan.md` and `starter-tasks.md`, and maybe a `questions.md`, but I’ll keep it minimal. Using `apply_patch`, I'll add these two new files and then update the statuses for our todos. Running `read_lints` isn't necessary for documentation, and I want to avoid creating any git commits right now. I'll suggest a commit message later.</details></think>

Creating the new documentation project and drafting the initial plan now, then I'll add a starter set of agent task briefs and a short questions list.

+## Chef Chopsky — Parallel Agent Operations Plan (v5)
+
+### Purpose
+Create a lightweight, repeatable system to delegate many small, parallelizable tasks to background agents (Cursor + others), review quickly, and ship vertical slices across frontend, agent graph, tests, and CI.
+
+### Scope and Principles
+- **Tech baseline**: TypeScript; React Native + React Native Web + Next.js; styling via gluestack UI + NativeWind; Supabase; Playwright E2E; LangChain/LangGraph for the agent.
+- **Small tasks, big throughput**: Tasks sized for 1–3 hours, batched 4–8/night in parallel.
+- **Definition of Done (DoD)**: Code + tests + docs, lint/types clean, E2E headless passing, small PR with clear description.
+- **Guardrails**: No DOM-only APIs in shared RN components; a11y basics; stick to repo conventions and CI gates.
+
+### Operating Cadence
+- **Nightly**: Dispatch a batch of parallel tasks with briefs and acceptance tests.
+- **Morning**: Review in 30–60 minutes; merge good PRs; one feedback cycle max; archive the rest.
+- **Weekly**: Inspect metrics (merged-per-day, rework rate, test flake rate), refine briefs and batch sizing.
+
+### Roles
+- **You (Editor-in-Chief)**: Curate backlog, approve briefs, review diffs, request one revision, merge or archive.
+- **Agents**: Implement tightly scoped briefs, add/update tests, keep CI green, document changes.
+
+### Workstreams
+1) Frontend UI: Shared RN/RNW components, pages, accessibility, error/empty states.
+2) Agent Graph: LangGraph nodes, tools, retries/backoff, structured errors, LangSmith traces/evals.
+3) Testing: Playwright E2E-first; fast, headless, resilient selectors; minimal fixtures.
+4) CI/DevEx: GitHub Actions stability, caching, fail-fast checks, auto-fix flows.
+5) Docs/Enablement: Keep docs current in `/documentation` and in-repo READMEs.
+
+### Task Brief Template
+Copy/paste and fill per task:
+
+```md
+Task: [verb-led title]
+Context: [links to files/dirs, product doc, screenshots]
+Goal: [user outcome + measurable acceptance]
+Constraints:
+- TypeScript everywhere; RN + RNW shared components; gluestack + NativeWind
+- Supabase DB; Playwright E2E; avoid web-only libs in shared code
+Definition of Done:
+- Code + tests + docs updated
+- Lint/types clean; Playwright passing headless; CI stable
+- Small PR with description and screenshots/recording if UI
+Artifacts:
+- PR title/description
+- Test names/paths changed
+- Before/after screenshots if UI
+Timebox: [e.g., 90 minutes]
+```
+
+### Review Checklist (fast)
+- Lint/types: zero errors.
+- Tests: new/updated Playwright for changes; stable role-based selectors; headless.
+- Cross-platform: no DOM-only APIs in shared components.
+- Accessibility: labels/roles on interactive elements.
+- PR size and clarity: ≤ ~300 changed lines, good description, assets attached when UI changes.
+
+### Evaluation and Telemetry
+- **Tracing**: Enable LangSmith tracing for key agent nodes and happy-path flows.
+- **Evals**: Maintain a minimal eval suite on core prompt/tool behaviors (dietary defaults, pantry utilization, refusal guardrails).
+- **Signals**: track merged-per-day, rework rate, test stability; improve plan and batch sizes accordingly.
+
+### Starter Batch (first week)
+- Frontend: `TypingIndicator`, `MessageBubble`, `Toast` components using gluestack + NativeWind.
+- E2E: Stable tests for conversation start/send/feedback flows.
+- Agent Graph: Add retry/backoff with structured errors to one node; add refusal guardrail.
+- Observability: Add LangSmith tracing on happy path in server.
+- CI: Improve caching and fail-fast in auto-fix workflows.
+
+### Risks and Mitigations
+- PR conflicts from parallelization → split by seam (UI vs tests vs agent vs CI); cap batch size.
+- Flaky E2E → role-based selectors, smaller fixtures, shorter timeouts.
+- Over-scoping → timebox per brief, prefer follow-up tasks.
+
+### Next Steps
+- Seed backlog with 8–12 briefs across workstreams.
+- Run one nightly batch; measure review time; adjust.
+- Establish weekly retro to promote best prompts and patterns.
+

I created a new project under `documentation/projects/v5: agent-parallelization/` with two docs: `plan.md` (operating model, DoD, review checklist) and `tasks.md` (5 starter briefs).

Questions for you
- Scope preference: Do you want the first batch focused on frontend UI + E2E only, or include one agent-graph/observability task as well?
- Constraints: Any strong UI/brand guidelines or component patterns you want enforced beyond gluestack + NativeWind?
- Data: Is it okay for tests to create/delete their own minimal data in Supabase, or do you want a fixed seed?
- CI: Should we modify the auto-fix workflow in this batch if needed, or leave CI changes for a separate PR?
- Tracing: Are we clear to add LangSmith tracing behind an env flag now?

If you confirm, I’ll prepare the first batch PR briefs exactly as-is, or tune them based on your answers.

---

_**User (2025-09-23 21:19Z)**_

I don't have a scope preference right now. In terms of constraints, I don't have many beyond using gluestack and nativewind. I also want to mention that all code should pass our CI tests, be built with responsive design principles in mind, and work across web, desktop, tablet, and mobile platforms. I'm open to either approach—whatever you think is best practice. I'm also open to drafting some CI changes as part of this work. I'm not sure what you mean by the tracing part in terms of leaving that behind a flag. I trust your judgment, but I'm happy to share more details.

Perfect! Let me clarify the tracing approach and update the task briefs with your requirements.

**LangSmith Tracing**: I meant adding optional tracing that only activates when `LANGSMITH_API_KEY` is set, so it doesn't spam logs in development but gives you observability in production. This is standard practice.

Let me update the task briefs with your constraints and add a CI improvement task:

- **Added CI improvement task**: Optimize caching and fail-fast checks in your workflows

**Ready-to-use batch of 6 tasks:**
1. **TypingIndicator** - Cross-platform animated indicator with responsive design
2. **MessageBubble** - Chat message component with responsive variants
3. **E2E Core Flows** - Stabilize conversation start/send/feedback tests
4. **Agent Retry Logic** - Add exponential backoff to LangGraph nodes
5. **LangSmith Tracing** - Environment-gated observability
6. **CI Optimization** - Improve caching and fail-fast checks

**Next steps for testing:**
- Pick 2-3 tasks from this batch to start with
- I can help you create detailed PR briefs for any of these
- Run them in parallel to test the workflow
- Measure review time and adjust batch sizing

Which tasks would you like to tackle first? I can prepare the detailed briefs with exact file paths, acceptance criteria, and artifacts for whichever ones you choose.

Perfect! I've created detailed briefs for all 3 tasks in `documentation/projects/v5: agent-parallelization/batch-1-briefs.md`. Here's how to kick them off:

## 🚀 Ready-to-Deploy Process

### **Step 1: Create Feature Branches**
```bash
git checkout -b feature/typing-indicator
git checkout -b feature/message-bubble  
git checkout -b feature/e2e-chat-flows
```

### **Step 2: Delegate to Agents (Parallel)**
Copy each brief from the file and give it to your agent with this prompt:

```
I need you to implement [TASK NAME] for Chef Chopsky. Here are the detailed requirements:

[COPY THE RELEVANT BRIEF FROM THE FILE]

Please:
1. Create the component/test file as specified
2. Follow the existing code patterns in the repo
3. Ensure all tests pass
4. Create a PR with a clear description and screenshots
5. Include the artifacts specified in the brief

Let me know if you need clarification on any requirements.
```

### **Step 3: Agent Workflow**
Each agent will:
1. **Analyze** the existing codebase patterns
2. **Implement** the component/test with proper TypeScript
3. **Test** locally (Playwright, lint, types)
4. **Create PR** with screenshots and clear description
5. **Wait** for your review

### **Step 4: Your Review (15-20 min per PR)**
Use the checklist in the briefs:
- [ ] TypeScript best practices
- [ ] Cross-platform compatibility (web/desktop/tablet/mobile)
- [ ] Tests pass locally and CI
- [ ] Responsive design verified
- [ ] Accessibility implemented
- [ ] Clear PR with screenshots

### **Step 5: Merge or Iterate**
- **Merge** if all criteria met
- **One revision** if minor issues
- **Archive** if major problems

## 🎯 Expected Outcomes

**TypingIndicator**: Animated three-dot indicator that scales across devices
**MessageBubble**: Reusable chat component with user/assistant variants and copy functionality  
**E2E Tests**: Stable tests for core chat flows with role-based selectors

## 📊 Success Metrics
- **Completion time**: 1-3 hours per task
- **Review time**: 15-20 minutes per PR
- **Revision rate**: <20% need revisions
- **Test stability**: No flaky failures

## 🔄 Next Steps
1. **Tonight**: Delegate all 3 tasks to agents
2. **Tomorrow morning**: Review PRs (45-60 minutes total)
3. **Measure**: Track completion times and revision rates
4. **Iterate**: Refine briefs based on results

The briefs are comprehensive and ready to copy-paste. Each agent will have everything they need to deliver a production-ready PR that meets your criteria. Want me to help you get started with the first delegation?

Tactically, how should I kick these off? Should I use the Cursor Client? A Cursor Background Agent? Another product entirely? Could you do a little @Web research to inform this?

---

_**Assistant (default)**_

Based on the web search results and your Chef Chopsky setup, here's the tactical approach for kicking off these 3 tasks:

## 🎯 Recommended Approach: Cursor Background Agents

**Why Cursor Background Agents are ideal for your use case:**
- **Integrated workflow**: They work directly within your existing Cursor environment
- **Concurrent execution**: Can handle multiple tasks in parallel while you sleep
- **Codebase awareness**: They understand your project structure, dependencies, and patterns
- **Review-ready output**: Generate PRs that integrate seamlessly with your existing workflow

## 🚀 Tactical Implementation Plan

### **Step 1: Set Up Cursor Background Agents**
1. **Enable Background Agents** in Cursor settings
2. **Configure project context** - ensure agents have access to your full codebase
3. **Set up task queues** - create separate queues for each workstream (UI, E2E, Agent Graph)

### **Step 2: Delegate Tasks (Parallel Execution)**
For each of the 3 tasks, use this exact workflow:

**Agent Prompt Template:**
```
Background Agent Task: [TASK NAME]

Project Context:
- React Native + React Native Web + Next.js
- TypeScript, NativeWind + gluestack UI
- Supabase database, Playwright E2E testing
- LangChain/LangGraph for AI agent

Task Brief:
[COPY THE RELEVANT BRIEF FROM batch-1-briefs.md]

Execution Requirements:
1. Work on feature branch: feature/[task-name]
2. Follow existing code patterns in the repo
3. Ensure all tests pass locally and in CI
4. Create PR with clear description and screenshots
5. Include all specified artifacts

Success Criteria:
- [ ] All Definition of Done items completed
- [ ] PR ready for review
- [ ] No CI failures
- [ ] Cross-platform compatibility verified

Timebox: 2-3 hours maximum
```

### **Step 3: Parallel Task Dispatch**
**Tonight (before sleep):**
- Delegate all 3 tasks simultaneously to different Background Agents
- Each agent works on their own feature branch
- Set up monitoring/notifications for completion

**Tomorrow morning:**
- Review all 3 PRs (45-60 minutes total)
- Use the review checklist from the briefs
- Merge good PRs, request revisions for others

## 🔧 Alternative Tools (If Cursor Background Agents aren't available)

**GitHub Copilot Coding Agent:**
- **Pros**: Integrated with GitHub, secure environment, automatic PR creation
- **Cons**: Limited to GitHub-hosted projects, may not understand your specific tech stack as well
- **Best for**: Bug fixes, test coverage, documentation updates

**Qudo AI:**
- **Pros**: Enterprise-grade, handles full software lifecycle
- **Cons**: May be overkill for your current needs, requires more setup
- **Best for**: Larger, more complex projects

## 📊 Success Metrics to Track

**Agent Performance:**
- Task completion time (target: 1-3 hours)
- First-time success rate (target: >80%)
- Revision rate (target: <20%)

**Code Quality:**
- CI pass rate (target: 100%)
- Test coverage maintenance
- Cross-platform compatibility

**Workflow Efficiency:**
- Review time per PR (target: 15-20 minutes)
- Time from delegation to merge (target: <24 hours)

## 🎯 Immediate Next Steps

1. **Test Cursor Background Agents** with one small task first
2. **Refine the briefs** based on initial results
3. **Scale to parallel execution** once you're confident in the workflow
4. **Measure and iterate** on the process

The key advantage of Cursor Background Agents is their deep integration with your existing development environment and understanding of your project's specific patterns and constraints. This should give you the highest success rate for your parallel agent delegation strategy.

Would you like me to help you set up the first test task with a Cursor Background Agent to validate this approach?
