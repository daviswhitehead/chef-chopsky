# Setting up my new macbook pro (2025-09-23 18:47Z)

_**User (2025-09-23 18:47Z)**_

I just got a new macbook pro. Can you install git and homebrew for me? And is there anything else you'd recommend I install right now?

---

_**Assistant (default)**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Installing git and Homebrew**

I need to install git and Homebrew on a new Mac using terminal commands. The rules state I should execute a single command per call and use absolute paths, so chaining commands is a no-go. For Homebrew, the install command is required. I can first download the installation script with curl, then execute it separately, which fits the regulations. Also, I need to install Xcode Command Line Tools for git, but that one uses an interactive GUI for installation.
**Considering Command Line Tools Installation**

I’m looking into installing Command Line Tools (CLT) non-interactively, but it's a bit cumbersome. On a new Mac, CLT may not be installed yet, and using Homebrew typically prompts for CLT installation. The Homebrew script might handle this non-GUI, which is handy! But if that doesn’t work, I’d need to install git via Xcode CLT. The best plan is to run the Homebrew install script which should trigger the CLT installation automatically. I’ll be using absolute paths and ensure I’m in the correct directory for my commands.
**Creating a to-do list for installation**

I’m setting up a to-do list since there are several steps involved: installing Command Line Tools and Homebrew, plus adding brew to the PATH for both Apple Silicon and Intel. I need to modify the shell profile, either /.zprofile or /.zshrc. The Homebrew installer provides instructions, but I can proactively add `eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"` to the profile for ARM and `/usr/local` for Intel. I’ll check the architecture with `uname -m`, but I won't run complex scripts. Instead, I’ll run the shellenv command afterward and ensure everything's set for the session. Finally, I’ll install git via Homebrew!
**Planning next installs**

Next, I’m considering recommending installs like iTerm2 and Oh My Zsh. The user seems to prefer npm over yarn, and I think it might be beneficial to suggest packages like asdf and Node via nvm since they use Node in their project. I could install nvm through Homebrew or a script. I want to recommend Xcode CLT, Homebrew, Git, and Node, with a note that they prefer npm, but I'll clarify before any additional installations. However, the user's request for recommendations gives me a chance to provide a list. For now, I’ll focus on git and Homebrew. The steps are clear: download the Homebrew install script, run it, and add brew shellenv to the profile using the detected path.
**Installing Homebrew and git**

I’m planning how to check which brew command to use. I’ll check `/opt/homebrew/bin/brew --version`, and if that fails, I'll try `/usr/local/bin/brew --version`. Depending on which exists, I’ll set the `BREW_BIN` variable. Next, I’ll use curl to download the Homebrew install script to `/tmp/install_homebrew.sh` and run it in non-interactive mode. Once Homebrew installs, I’ll confirm the version with `$BREW_BIN --version` and install git. For appending the shell environment setup to `.zprofile`, I can echo the line without running into variable expansion issues. I’ll make sure to include conditional logic for either path detected as `BREW_BIN`.
**Executing installation steps**

I can't do compound tests, so I'll check which brew exists and run the corresponding echo command afterward. To determine which command to use, I'll start with `ls /opt/homebrew/bin/brew`, and if that works, I'll append the ARM line; otherwise, I'll append the Intel line. 

Next, I’ll run sequential commands to create a temporary directory, set `NONINTERACTIVE`, download the Homebrew installer, execute it, check the brew version, and install git. After that, I'll append the appropriate `eval` line to `.zprofile`. 

I’ll also mention other installations, but won't install them unless the user asks. Let’s create a to-do list, marking the first task as in progress and execute the steps accordingly!</details></think>

---

I'll set up Homebrew (non-interactively), ensure it's on your PATH, then install Git via Homebrew. Then I’ll share a short list of recommended tools for a fresh macOS dev setup. Proceeding now.

---

Tool use: **todo_write**

## Todo List

- [-] Install Homebrew non-interactively on macOS
- [ ] Add Homebrew to PATH in shell profile
- [ ] Install Git using Homebrew
- [ ] Recommend additional developer tools to install now

---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Executing commands carefully**

I need to run commands, but there are specific rules to follow: one command per call, using absolute paths, and no chaining. The Homebrew install command is typically run as a bash script and needs to be non-interactive for ARM Macs, which have a Homebrew path of /opt/homebrew. The install command involves using curl to fetch the script, but I can't use command substitution. So, I plan to first check if Homebrew exists with the command `which -s brew`.
**Planning Homebrew installation**

I can go ahead and attempt the installation now. My first step is to use curl to download the install script to `/tmp/install_homebrew.sh` with the `-fsSL` options. When running the script, I want it to be non-interactive, which means I should export the `NONINTERACTIVE=1` environment variable in a separate command, as I can't set it inline. Then I’ll also set `CI=1` for continuous integration purposes. After installation, I’ll append the recommended PATH setting to `/.zprofile` using an echo command.
**Managing Homebrew environment**

I can echo the necessary line into the file, and for immediate use, I want to execute `eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"`, but command substitution isn’t allowed. Instead, I’ll source the output by running `/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv`, directing it to a temporary file and then sourcing that file. 

I'll first add the line to `/.zprofile`, then run the brew command to create the temp file and source it with `. /tmp/brew_env`. Finally, I’ll install git, but I'll need to make sure the Xcode Command Line Tools are installed, even though that might trigger a GUI prompt, making it non-interactive.
**Executing Homebrew installation steps**

Homebrew does have a fallback to download the Command Line Tools (CLT) without prompting, which could be tricky since it often opens a GUI. If it's set to non-interactive, that might prevent it from working. An alternative is to install via Apple's command line tools using softwareupdate, but that could get complex. So, I’ll attempt the Homebrew installation first and, if it fails due to the CLT, I’ll recommend accepting the GUI prompt. I’ll run commands sequentially while following the single command per line rule. 

The steps are: export the environment variables, download the install script, run the script, append the eval line, and finally generate and source the brew environment.
**Finalizing installation checks**

I want to verify the Homebrew installation by checking its version first with `brew --version`. Then, I’ll proceed to install git using `brew install git`. Once that’s done, I need to verify the git installation too by running `git --version`, which should be accessible at `/opt/homebrew/bin/git` after sourcing the environment. 

After ensuring everything is set up correctly, I can provide a recommended tools list without actually running the installations. Let's implement these steps now!</details></think>

---

I'll install Homebrew non-interactively, add it to your PATH, then install Git with Homebrew. If Xcode Command Line Tools are required, macOS may show a GUI prompt—accepting it will let the install proceed. Proceeding with the installation now.

_**User (2025-09-23 18:47Z)**_

Wait, do people still use Homebrew? Is it still a modern choice? Maybe do a quick research for me on this? @Web 

---

_**Assistant (default)**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Summarizing Homebrew options**

I need to respond to a request about Homebrew as a modern choice. The user provided web search results, so I don't need to run the web search tool again. Homebrew 4.6.0, supported as of August 5, 2025, ends support for macOS Monterey. It’s popular, but I should mention alternatives like MacPorts, Nix, and Conda. I also want to update the to-do list, pausing the installation to add a task for research on Homebrew’s viability in 2025. I'm thinking about how to manage this well!
**Updating task status**

I see that we should use `todo_write` for multi-step tasks, but since this is a read-only question, we might skip that here. However, I know we need to mark the installation tasks as paused until the user confirms. I'll update our tasks: cancel the install, add the completed research task, and include a concise status update. 

For my response, I plan to confirm that Homebrew is still modern, supports macOS 26, and mention alternatives when needed!
**Planning installation tasks**

I have a list of installations to manage: Xcode Command Line Tools, Homebrew, Git, mise, Node (via mise), and potentially pnpm/npm, with a preference for npm. I'll also mention VS Code, iTerm2, Docker Desktop, 1Password, Rectangle, and Raycast, but I want to keep things concise. 

Finally, I’ll ask if I should proceed with installing Homebrew and Git now while confirming we can run non-interactively and handle PATH. I also need to update the to-do list to mark installation tasks as canceled pending approval and note that the research task is completed.</details></think>

---

I paused the install to answer your research question first. I’ll record the recommendation, then we can proceed with installation if you confirm.

## Todo List

- [!] Install Homebrew non-interactively on macOS
- [!] Add Homebrew to PATH in shell profile

---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Researching Homebrew relevance**

I need to summarize my research on Homebrew's relevance using the web search results provided. Even though the user gave me information, it seems like it’s advisable to use a web search tool for the latest updates.

I’ll also note that we have a good status, having canceled installs and completed the research tasks. I’m considering adding alternatives like MacPorts, Nix, asdf, and Volta, while mentioning that Xcode CLT includes git. I’ll affirm that Homebrew remains modern and recommend proceeding with its installation. 

Let's check if the user agrees!
**Summarizing Homebrew installation**

The user's query is focused on research, so I need to address that directly before potentially adding any recommendations later. I'll keep my response brief and ask if they’d like to proceed with the installation.

I should mention that for Apple Silicon, the installation path is `/opt/homebrew`. I want to ensure my summary is concise and formatted correctly, using headings and bullet points for clarity. 

Let’s move forward with that!</details></think>

---

I paused before installing to answer your question.

### Is Homebrew still a modern choice in 2025?
- **Yes—still dominant and modern.** Homebrew continues to be the de facto macOS package manager. A recent release (e.g., 4.6.0 in Aug 2025) added support for newer macOS versions, showing active maintenance and ecosystem health.
- **Support policy matters.** Homebrew drops older macOS releases over time (e.g., ended support for macOS 12 Monterey), which is normal for modern tooling. Your new MacBook on a supported macOS is ideal.
- **Ecosystem strength.** Vast formulae/casks, frequent updates, easy uninstall, solid community, and clear taps. For most mac devs, it’s the most practical choice.

### Alternatives (when to consider them)
- **Nix**: Reproducible, declarative dev envs. Great for teams and CI; steeper learning curve.
- **MacPorts**: Stable but smaller ecosystem; less common in today’s mac dev workflows.
- **asdf/mise + language-specific managers**: Use alongside Homebrew for languages (Node, Python, Ruby). They complement rather than replace Homebrew.
- **App Store/DMG**: Fine for GUI apps; not a replacement for CLI packages.

Bottom line: **Homebrew remains a modern, widely used choice in 2025**. For a new MacBook Pro, I recommend proceeding with Homebrew, then installing Git via Homebrew (or via Xcode CLT if you prefer Apple’s distribution).

Would you like me to install Homebrew now and then install Git? If yes, I’ll run the non-interactive setup, add it to your PATH, and install Git.

_**User (2025-09-23 18:47Z)**_

Yep, let's install homebrew and then git

---

_**Assistant (default)**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Working with brew installation**

To use brew right away, I can use the absolute path, like /opt/homebrew/bin/brew install git, avoiding the need to adjust the PATH for now. The TODO mentioned adding it later. I realize I need to run: echo 'eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"' >> /.zprofile. This command substitution is fine as a string. Then once brew is set up, I’ll install Git using the absolute path. I should also manage the noninteractive variable since shell persistence might be an issue. I should check if we're in the same shell!
**Executing commands for installation**

I can use NONINTERACTIVE=1 in the command without needing an export, like this: NONINTERACTIVE=1 /bin/bash -c "...". The rules allow a single command, so I have to be careful about chaining commands together.

My steps are to first download the install script to a temporary file using curl: curl -fsSL -o /tmp/install.sh [URL]. Then, I'll run it with NONINTERACTIVE=1. This method keeps everything compliant by separating the installations into distinct calls, which is good!
**Outlining installation steps**

I'm thinking through the installation steps: 

1) First, I'll use curl to download the install script with this command: curl -fsSL -o /tmp/homebrew_install.sh [URL].

2) Then I'll run the script using NONINTERACTIVE=1 /bin/bash /tmp/homebrew_install.sh. 

Now, this might prompt for a password since it could need sudo to create directories under /opt/homebrew. The script generally avoids sudo, but it may request ownership changes. Using NONINTERACTIVE means it may fail if it can't run non-interactively, which is tricky, especially with possible password prompts. I should consider the timeout command, but since macOS may not have it, I'm exploring safer alternatives, like using Xcode's CLT, though that involves some additional GUI interactions.
**Planning the script execution**

Okay, I think I should try running the script and if it fails, I'll handle the error then. I want to ensure I include a status update before making any tool calls so I know what’s going on. After successfully installing, I’ll remember to append the necessary lines to /.zprofile. Then, I’ll install Git using the absolute path for brew. It feels like a solid plan, so let’s execute it!</details></think>

---

I'll download the Homebrew installer script to a temp file, run it non-interactively, add Homebrew to your PATH, then install Git using the absolute brew path to avoid PATH issues. If the installer requires your password, it may prompt in the terminal—please approve it there.

Need sudo access on macOS (e.g. the user daviswhitehead needs to be an Administrator)!

```

---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Explaining installation permissions**

If /opt exists and I have the right permissions, maybe I don't need sudo. But on a fresh Mac, that's probably not the case. So I’ll need to pause and request the admin password to proceed with the interactive install. If they give approval, I can provide a command prompt, but since the tool doesn’t allow interactivity, it’s better to give them a one-liner to run. We can’t proceed until brew is installed, so we should confirm after they install it.
**Proposing a solution for installation**

That's a clever approach! The user enters their password once, activating the sudo timestamp, which means the NONINTERACTIVE=1 brew installer could work. I can propose that they run `sudo -v` in their terminal, which will prompt them once. After they confirm with "done," I can continue with the installation process. I should mark the task as blocked for now and provide a status update while keeping everything brief.</details></think>

---

I tried to install Homebrew non-interactively, but it requires sudo and the shell can’t accept your password.

- To proceed now: run this locally in your Terminal to cache sudo for a few minutes:
```bash
sudo -v
```
Reply “done” after that, and I’ll continue the install non-interactively.

If you’d prefer to do it yourself instead, run:
```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

Once sudo is cached or Homebrew is installed, I’ll add it to your PATH and install Git.

_**User (2025-09-23 18:47Z)**_

ok i think homebrew is installed now... can you verify and then help me move on to the next step?

_**Assistant (default)**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Verifying brew installation**

I need to verify if brew is installed and add it to the PATH, then install git. I'll use separate commands with run_terminal_cmd, ensuring a single command per call while providing status updates before each tool call. I need to write out the todos, marking the installation of Homebrew as completed and adding to PATH as in progress. 

Once I verify brew with `brew --version` and `brew doctor`, I’ll proceed to install git using the absolute path to avoid issues. I'll also recommend additional tools afterward. Let's get started with the status update!
**Checking Brew and Path Setup**

I need to check if the brew path is in the PATH using `/opt/homebrew/bin/brew --version`. If it's successful, I'll mark Homebrew as installed. Then, I’ll add to the PATH by running separate echo commands for /.zprofile, following the single command rule.

First, I’ll create the file if it doesn’t exist. After that, I’ll run the eval command and verify brew is in the PATH using `command -v brew`. Finally, I’ll install Git and check its version, then update the todos, suggesting additional tools afterward. Let's begin with the initial brew check!</details></think>

---

I'll verify Homebrew via its absolute path, then add it to your PATH by updating `~/.zprofile` and sourcing `brew shellenv`. After that, I’ll install Git with Homebrew and confirm versions.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Recommending additional tools**

I've installed brew and git, so now I need to recommend some additional tools. I’ll suggest grouping them for clarity. It might be a good idea to configure git with a name and email, providing the commands for that. For optional installs, I could mention tools like gh, nvm, node, and various others, while noting the rule about npm. I'll also consider terminal tools like iTerm2, Rectangle, and others. Lastly, I could run brew doctor, but it's optional and I'll provide updates as I go.
**Finalizing recommendations**

I need to mark the task to recommend tools as completed after I give the suggestions. I should set this to completed before summarizing everything, and I won’t need any tool calls for that. I’ll also confirm which versions have been displayed. At this point, I won’t run any more terminal commands, but I can provide the commands in the message.

Homebrew is installed and on your PATH. Git is installed.

- Homebrew: Homebrew 4.6.13
- Git: git version 2.51.0

Next, I recommend:
- Configure Git identity
- Install core dev tools
- Optional: SSH keys + GitHub CLI

Commands:
- Set Git name: git config --global user.name "Your Name"
- Set Git email: git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
- Enable helpful defaults: git config --global init.defaultBranch main
- Show colored UI: git config --global color.ui auto
- See config: git config --global --list

Would you like me to:
- Generate SSH keys and add to ssh-agent
- Install GitHub CLI, Node.js (mise or nvm), Python, Docker Desktop, VS Code, iTerm2, zsh tools (fzf, ripgrep, bat), and fonts?

- Your preferred Git email (GitHub noreply or real email)

Then I’ll run:
- git config --global user.name "<Your Name>"
- git config --global user.email "<you@example.com>"
- git config --global init.defaultBranch main
- git config --global color.ui auto

Optional (recommended):
- git config --global pull.rebase false
- git config --global credential.helper osxkeychain

Share your name/email and I’ll apply these now.

I'll do this myself, can you walk me through the steps I should take to get this set up?

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Configuring Git Steps**

I need to provide clear steps for configuring Git name/email and setting defaults, as well as some optional SSH setup with GitHub CLI. Since the user prefers a walkthrough instead of running commands, I’ll keep it simple and provide concise commands with explanations. Updates on the status aren’t necessary since I won’t make tool calls. I’ll also ensure that any irrelevant information about npm or diffs is omitted. Here are the steps:  
1. Set name/email.  
2. Set defaults.  
3. Verify settings.  
4. Fix any VS Code errors.  
5. (Optional) Set up SSH key and GitHub CLI authentication.</details></think>

### Configure Git globally (name, email, helpful defaults)
Run these in Terminal, replacing with your details:

- Set identity:
```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
```
- Recommended defaults:
```bash
git config --global init.defaultBranch main
git config --global color.ui auto
git config --global pull.rebase false
git config --global credential.helper osxkeychain
```

### Verify it worked
```bash
git config --global --list
```
You should see `user.name=...` and `user.email=...`.

### Notes
- If you prefer GitHub’s privacy email: Settings → Emails → “Keep my email address private,” then use your noreply (`123456+username@users.noreply.github.com`).
- If VS Code still shows “Author identity unknown,” reload the window and try again after setting the config.

### Optional (SSH for GitHub)
- Generate key:
```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "you@example.com"
```
Press Enter to accept defaults; set a passphrase if you want.
- Start agent and add key:
```bash
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
ssh-add --apple-use-keychain ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
```
- Copy public key and add to GitHub → Settings → SSH and GPG keys:
```bash
pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
```
- Test:
```bash
ssh -T git@github.com
```

Want me to tailor these for a GitHub noreply email or set editor/line endings too?
