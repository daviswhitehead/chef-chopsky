<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Explaining MONGO_NAMESPACE_PREFIX**

I need to clarify what **MONGO_NAMESPACE_PREFIX** means in the `env.example` file. It's used when working with a MongoDB vector store for retrieval. This prefix helps isolate data per app or environment, allowing for unique namespaces like `retrieval_local` or `retrieval_staging`. If you aren't using Mongo, you can ignore this setting. Since the user referenced `@.env.example`, I should focus directly on that file for my answer.
**Providing Status Updates**

The guidelines mention providing status updates when making tool calls, but since we didn't use any tools, we can skip this. According to the summary specifications, if the user asked a basic query, I can skip the summary too. I'll keep the answer concise, include example values, and avoid being overly verbose. Formatting with markdown headings sounds helpful, so I'll provide a short paragraph followed by bullet points. Let's go ahead with that approach!</details></think>

**Short answer:** `MONGO_NAMESPACE_PREFIX` sets the base namespace (prefix) used when storing/retrieving vectors/documents in MongoDB-backed vector search. It helps isolate data by app/env.

- **What it’s for**: Namespacing collections/indexes when using a MongoDB vector store (e.g., LangChain + MongoDB/Atlas Vector Search), so different environments don’t collide.
- **Typical usage**: Combined with an env discriminator to form namespaces like `retrieval_local`, `retrieval_staging`, `retrieval_production`.
- **When relevant**: Only matters if your retriever/vector store is MongoDB (not `memory`, Pinecone, Elastic, etc.). If you’re not using Mongo, it can be ignored.
