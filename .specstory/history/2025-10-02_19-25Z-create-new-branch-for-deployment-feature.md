# Create new branch for deployment feature (2025-10-02 19:25Z)

_**User (2025-10-02 19:20Z)**_

Create a new branch for this new feature that I'm working on that's focused on deploying code to a production environment.

_**Assistant (default)**_

I'll create a new branch for your production deployment feature. Let me create a descriptive branch name and switch to it.


---

Tool use: **run_terminal_cmd**

```bash
cd /Users/daviswhitehead/Library/CloudStorage/GoogleDrive-whitehead.davis@gmail.com/My\ Drive/github/chef-chopsky && git checkout -b feature/production-deployment
```

```
Switched to a new branch 'feature/production-deployment'

```

---

Perfect! I've created a new branch called `feature/production-deployment` and switched to it. You're now ready to work on your production deployment feature in this isolated branch.

The branch name follows conventional naming patterns and clearly describes the feature you're working on. When you're ready, you can commit your changes to this branch and then create a pull request to merge it back into main.
