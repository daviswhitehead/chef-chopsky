I found a Notion page titled:

**"A 3-step AI coding workflow for solo founders | Ryan Carson (5x founder) - YouTube - How I AI"**

- This appears to be a brief or resource related to founder workflows, specifically focusing on an AI coding workflow for solo founders, as described by Ryan Carson (a 5x founder).
- The page includes a link to the YouTube video: [A 3-step AI coding workflow for solo founders | Ryan Carson (5x founder) - YouTube - How I AI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fD4ktSkNCw4&ab_channel=HowIAI)
- The Notion page was last edited on June 10, 2025.

If you want a summary or the main points from this document, let me know! I can also try to extract more details or content from the page if you need.

Based on your Founder Brief and the current Chef Chopsky concept, here are targeted recommendations to better align the repository and product direction with your personal motivations, values, and goals:

---

## 1. **Deepen Alignment with Core Values**

- **Usefulness > Novelty:**  
  Ensure every feature solves a real user problem. Prioritize features that you (and your target users) will use weekly. For example, double down on the CSA-to-meal workflow and feedback loop, and avoid ‚Äúnice-to-have‚Äù features that don‚Äôt drive core value.

- **Sustainability > Scale:**  
  Build for maintainability and solo founder efficiency. Automate repetitive tasks (e.g., feedback collection, meal memory) and leverage AI for content and workflow generation. Avoid features that require heavy manual curation or ongoing support.

- **Simplicity > Complexity:**  
  Ruthlessly simplify the UI/UX and codebase. Every workflow (meal planning, feedback, learning) should be as frictionless as possible. Consider a ‚Äúone-screen‚Äù or ‚Äúone-conversation‚Äù approach for the MVP.

- **Freedom > Status:**  
  Focus on features that maximize your independence as a builder and user. For example, build tools that let you quickly iterate on recipes, meal plans, and user feedback without waiting for external input.

- **Craftsmanship > Speed:**  
  Take pride in the details‚Äîrecipe formatting, feedback prompts, and user memory. Build a ‚Äúdelight checklist‚Äù for every user-facing feature.

- **Humanity > Generated:**  
  Infuse the product with warmth, humor, and a sense of care. Make sure the AI‚Äôs tone and suggestions feel genuinely supportive and human, not generic.

---

## 2. **Leverage Your Strengths & Superpowers**

- **Thoughtfulness & Generalist Skills:**  
  Document and automate your best practices for meal planning, feedback, and learning. Build ‚Äúexplain why‚Äù and ‚Äúpro tip‚Äù sections into recipes and feedback flows.

- **Product Mindset & User Empathy:**  
  Regularly review user feedback (even if it‚Äôs just your own) and iterate on the product. Build in mechanisms for the product to ask you what could be better, and act on it.

- **Strong Writing & Community Building:**  
  Consider adding a ‚ÄúChopsky‚Äôs Notes‚Äù or ‚ÄúFounder‚Äôs Corner‚Äù section where you share personal insights, tips, or stories. This can help build a sense of community and authenticity.

---

## 3. **Address Constraints & Weak Spots**

- **Time Constraints:**  
  Automate as much as possible. Use AI to generate meal plans, shopping lists, and even code snippets for new features. Build ‚Äúquick add‚Äù and ‚Äúone-click‚Äù workflows.

- **Solo Building:**  
  Avoid features that require a team to maintain. Use open-source tools and templates where possible. Build modularly so you can add or remove features easily.

- **Energy Management:**  
  Build dashboards or reminders to help you track your own energy and avoid burnout (e.g., ‚ÄúHow much time did I spend cooking this week?‚Äù).

- **High Bar for Quality:**  
  Create a ‚Äúquality checklist‚Äù for every release. Use automated tests and linters to maintain standards without manual effort.

---

## 4. **Clarify and Track Long-Term Goals**

- **Transition to Full-Time Solopreneurship:**  
  Build features that could eventually support monetization (e.g., premium ‚ÄúCoach Mode,‚Äù personal cookbook, integrations).

- **6-Figure, Profitable Product:**  
  Start tracking metrics that matter for revenue (e.g., user engagement, retention, feedback quality).

- **Flagship Products with PMF:**  
  Focus on nailing the core CSA-to-meal workflow and feedback loop before expanding.

- **Audience Growth:**  
  Consider lightweight ways to share your journey (e.g., a public changelog, newsletter integration, or ‚Äúshare your meal plan‚Äù feature).

---

## 5. **Specific Repository/Concept Changes**

- **Documentation:**  
  Add a `FOUNDER_BRIEF.md` or ‚ÄúProduct Philosophy‚Äù doc to the repo, summarizing your values and goals. Reference this in PRs and product decisions.

- **Feedback Loop:**  
  Make the feedback and learning loop more prominent in the product. Automate the collection and use of feedback to improve recommendations.

- **Skill-Building:**  
  Add ‚Äúpro tip‚Äù and ‚Äúwhy this works‚Äù sections to recipes and instructions, as suggested in your V2 feedback.

- **Personalization:**  
  Enhance memory and personalization features‚Äîtrack likes/dislikes, ingredient preferences, and cooking styles.

- **Simplicity:**  
  Audit the codebase for complexity. Remove or postpone features that don‚Äôt directly serve your core workflow or values.

Can you synthesize this down into your top ten actionable recommendations?

_**Assistant**_

Absolutely! Here are the top ten actionable recommendations to align Chef Chopsky with your Founder Brief and maximize your impact as a solopreneur:

---

### 1. **Add a FOunder Brief/Philosophy Doc**
Create a `FOUNDER_BRIEF.md` in your repo summarizing your mission, values, and long-term goals. Reference this in product and code decisions to keep alignment front and center.

### 2. **Ruthlessly Prioritize Usefulness**
Review all features and backlog items. Remove or postpone anything that doesn‚Äôt directly solve a real user problem or that you wouldn‚Äôt use yourself every week.

### 3. **Automate Feedback Loops**
Build or improve automated systems for collecting, analyzing, and acting on user feedback (even if it‚Äôs just your own). Make this a core part of the product‚Äôs learning and improvement cycle.

### 4. **Simplify the User Experience**
Audit the UI/UX and workflows for friction. Streamline to a ‚Äúone-screen‚Äù or ‚Äúone-conversation‚Äù approach for the MVP. Every interaction should be as simple and clear as possible.

### 5. **Infuse Humanity and Warmth**
Ensure the AI‚Äôs tone, prompts, and suggestions are warm, encouraging, and human‚Äînot generic. Add ‚Äúpro tip‚Äù and ‚Äúwhy this works‚Äù sections to recipes and instructions.

### 6. **Leverage Your Generalist Strengths**
Document and automate your best practices for meal planning, feedback, and learning. Build tools that let you quickly iterate and connect dots across disciplines.

### 7. **Build for Solo Founder Efficiency**
Automate repetitive tasks (e.g., meal plan generation, shopping lists, code snippets). Use modular code and open-source tools to minimize maintenance overhead.

### 8. **Track and Protect Your Time/Energy**
Add features or reminders to help you monitor time spent building and cooking, and to protect evenings/weekends for recovery and relationships.

### 9. **Lay Groundwork for Monetization**
Start tracking metrics that matter for future revenue (e.g., engagement, retention). Consider which features could become premium (e.g., ‚ÄúCoach Mode,‚Äù cookbook, integrations).

### 10. **Share Your Journey and Build Community**
Add a ‚ÄúFounder‚Äôs Corner‚Äù or public changelog. Consider lightweight ways to share insights, tips, or progress (e.g., newsletter integration, ‚Äúshare your meal plan‚Äù feature) to grow your audience and foster authenticity.
