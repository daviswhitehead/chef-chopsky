_**User (2025-10-02 19:20Z)**_

I'd like your help further refining and defining an AI product development playbook. I'd like for you to read through the following resources and then help me plan out how to make this playbook super tactical for me:
- @https://www.specflow.com/ 
- @https://www.specflow.com/why-plan-first.html 
- @https://www.specflow.com/about.html
- @https://www.specflow.com/getting-started.html  
- @https://www.specflow.com/reference/ 
- @https://www.specflow.com/reddit-wisdom/ 
- @https://www.specflow.com/reddit-wisdom/evolution/ 
- @https://www.specflow.com/reddit-wisdom/guides/posts/the-ultimate-vibe-coding-guide/ 
- @https://www.specflow.com/reddit-wisdom/patterns/ 
- @https://github.com/specstoryai/specflow/tree/main 

Here are some questions:
- Very tactically within their coding and product development process, how are best-in-class solo entrepreneurs integrating AI throughout their process? What does that look like for them?
- How do we take the resources I've shared with you above and turn that into a tactical playbook for me? What are the different phases of that playbook and what are the different roles that we (AI and me) would need to play to deliver super effectively within each phase?
- To make this playbook tactical, what are the assets you'd recommend we create? Is that Markdown files? Is that templates? Is that cursor rules? Should we be using cursor? Should we be using cloud code? Curious to hear your guidance.

Feel free to search @Web for more details if you need.

| Web Search Results |  | Developing a tactical AI product development playbook involves integrating structured methodologies like Specflow with best practices from solo entrepreneurs who have successfully incorporated AI into their processes. Here's a comprehensive plan to create a playbook tailored to your needs:<br/><br/>**1. Understanding Specflow and Its Relevance**<br/><br/>Specflow is a structured approach to building software with AI agents, emphasizing planning before execution to ensure clarity and efficiency. It consists of five phases: Intent, Roadmap, Tasks, Execute, and Refine. <br/><br/>**2. Best Practices for Solo Entrepreneurs Integrating AI**<br/><br/>Solo entrepreneurs have found success by treating AI as a collaborative partner rather than just a tool. Key practices include:<br/><br/>- **Role Definition**: Assigning specific roles to AI, such as a junior developer or product manager, to guide its outputs effectively.<br/><br/>- **Context Preservation**: Maintaining detailed documentation to provide AI with the necessary context, reducing inconsistencies.<br/><br/>- **Task Decomposition**: Breaking down projects into manageable tasks that can be effectively handled by AI, ensuring quality and coherence.<br/><br/>These practices have evolved through community insights and are detailed in the "Reddit Wisdom" section of Specflow. <br/><br/>**3. Structuring Your AI Product Development Playbook**<br/><br/>To create a tactical playbook, align it with the Specflow methodology:<br/><br/>- **Phase 1: Intent**<br/><br/>  - *Objective*: Clearly define the project's goals and success criteria.<br/><br/>  - *Roles*:<br/><br/>    - *You*: Articulate the vision, problem statement, and constraints.<br/><br/>    - *AI*: Assist in refining the intent document and identifying potential challenges.<br/><br/>- **Phase 2: Roadmap**<br/><br/>  - *Objective*: Break down the project into phases with clear milestones.<br/><br/>  - *Roles*:<br/><br/>    - *You*: Outline major phases and dependencies.<br/><br/>    - *AI*: Suggest optimal sequencing and highlight potential risks.<br/><br/>- **Phase 3: Tasks**<br/><br/>  - *Objective*: Decompose phases into actionable tasks.<br/><br/>  - *Roles*:<br/><br/>    - *You*: Define tasks and assign responsibilities.<br/><br/>    - *AI*: Generate task details, subtasks, and required resources.<br/><br/>- **Phase 4: Execute**<br/><br/>  - *Objective*: Implement tasks collaboratively.<br/><br/>  - *Roles*:<br/><br/>    - *You*: Oversee progress, provide feedback, and make decisions.<br/><br/>    - *AI*: Develop code, create documentation, and perform initial testing.<br/><br/>- **Phase 5: Refine**<br/><br/>  - *Objective*: Iterate based on feedback and improve the product.<br/><br/>  - *Roles*:<br/><br/>    - *You*: Evaluate outputs, gather user feedback, and prioritize refinements.<br/><br/>    - *AI*: Implement changes, optimize performance, and update documentation.<br/><br/>**4. Recommended Assets for a Tactical Playbook**<br/><br/>To make the playbook actionable, consider creating the following assets:<br/><br/>- **Markdown Files**: For documentation, intent statements, and task lists.<br/><br/>- **Templates**: Standardized formats for intent documents, roadmaps, and task breakdowns.<br/><br/>- **Cursor Rules**: If using the Cursor editor, define rules to maintain code consistency and quality.<br/><br/>- **Cloud Code**: Utilize cloud-based development environments for collaboration and scalability.<br/><br/>These assets will provide structure and clarity, facilitating efficient collaboration between you and AI tools.<br/><br/>By integrating these elements, your AI product development playbook will be both strategic and tactical, enabling effective collaboration and successful project outcomes. |

## Cursor rules reorganized

Reorganized `.cursor/rules` with a priority system to avoid conflicts and keep behavior consistent.

### **Priority system (1–7)**

**Priority 1–3: Core rules (always applied)**
- `01-core-conventions.mdc`: Project foundation, architecture, critical environment rules
- `02-terminal-safety.mdc`: Terminal safety and process management
- `03-ai-service-development.mdc`: AI service development and mock mode prevention

**Priority 4–6: Feature rules (conditionally applied)**
- `04-ai-feature-development.mdc`: AI-first feature development workflow
- `05-automated-testing.mdc`: Testing strategy and best practices
- `06-pull-request-preparation.mdc`: PR preparation and code quality

**Priority 7: Tool-specific rules (context-aware)**
- `07-playwright-test-generator.mdc`: Playwright test generation using MCP tools

### **Conflict resolution**
1. Higher priority rules override lower priority rules
2. Core rules (1–3) always take precedence
3. Feature rules (4–6) can be overridden by core rules
4. Tool-specific rules (7) only apply in their context

### **Benefits**
- Clear hierarchy: numbered priorities
- Conflict prevention: higher priority wins
- Context awareness: rules apply when relevant
- Maintainability: easier to add, update, or remove rules
- Documentation: README explains the system

### **Rule configuration**
Each rule includes:
- Priority number (01–07)
- Description
- Globs (file patterns)
- alwaysApply (always vs context-dependent)
- Tools (for tool-specific rules)

### **Usage**
- Core rules (1–3) enforce project standards
- Feature rules (4–6) guide specific development phases
- Tool-specific rules (7) activate with specific tools
- Priority system prevents conflicts and keeps behavior predictable

This structure keeps AI behavior consistent and predictable while allowing flexibility for different development contexts.

## Cursor rules updated to community best practices

Updated the Cursor rules to follow the [community best practices from the Cursor forum discussion](https://forum.cursor.com/t/my-best-practices-for-mdc-rules-and-troubleshooting/50526).

### **Changes made**

#### **1. Three-digit naming system**
- **Core Rules (001-099)**: Foundation rules that are always applied
- **Integration Rules (100-199)**: Development phase-specific rules
- **Pattern/Role Rules (200-299)**: Tool-specific and context-aware rules

#### **2. Proper MDC format**
- **YAML front matter**: Only required fields (`description`, `globs`, `alwaysApply`)
- **Removed custom fields**: Eliminated `priority` field (handled by filename numbering)
- **Standardized structure**: Consistent format across all rules

#### **3. Priority system**
- **001-003**: Core rules (always applied, highest priority)
- **100-120**: Integration rules (conditionally applied, medium priority)
- **200+**: Pattern/role rules (context-aware, lowest priority)

### **New rule structure**

```
.cursor/rules/
├── 001-core-conventions.mdc          # Project foundation & architecture
├── 002-terminal-safety.mdc           # Terminal safety & process management
├── 003-ai-service-development.mdc    # AI service development standards
├── 100-ai-feature-development.mdc    # AI-first feature development workflow
├── 110-automated-testing.mdc         # Testing strategy & best practices
├── 120-pull-request-preparation.mdc  # PR preparation & code quality
├── 200-playwright-test-generator.mdc # Playwright test generation
└── README.md                         # Documentation
```

### **Documentation**

Created `docs/playbook/cursor-rules-organization.md` covering:
- **Organization system**: Three-digit naming and categorization
- **Priority hierarchy**: How rules override each other
- **MDC format**: Proper YAML front matter structure
- **Conflict resolution**: Clear guidelines for handling rule conflicts
- **Best practices**: Community-validated approaches
- **Troubleshooting**: Common issues and solutions
- **Management guidelines**: Adding, updating, and removing rules

### **Benefits**

1. **Community-validated**: Based on real-world usage and testing
2. **Conflict prevention**: Clear priority system prevents rule conflicts
3. **Maintainable**: Easy to add, update, and remove rules
4. **Well-documented**: Comprehensive guide for management
5. **Troubleshooting**: Solutions for common MDC file issues

### **Key insights from community**

- **MDC files require proper YAML front matter** with only required fields
- **Three-digit naming system** provides clear priority hierarchy
- **Rules load based on filename numbers** (lower numbers = higher priority)
- **Last rule wins in conflicts** (like thermostat control)
- **Settings UI is most reliable** for creating MDC files
- **Close Cursor completely** if MDC files aren't saving properly

This structure aligns with community best practices and should provide consistent, predictable AI behavior while preventing rule conflicts.

#### **AI-specific rules (6-10)**
- Context preservation
- Iterative development
- Error handling and resilience
- Performance and scalability
- Security and best practices

#### **Workflow rules (11-14)**
- Development process
- Communication and collaboration
- Quality gates
- Deployment and operations

#### **Technology-specific rules (15-17)**
- React/Next.js development
- Backend development
- Testing frameworks

#### **Environment and configuration (18-20)**
- Environment management
- Dependencies and packages
- Git and version control

#### **Success criteria (21-23)**
- Code quality
- Collaboration
- Project success

### **Benefits**

1. Single source of truth for AI development rules
2. Proper MDC format with YAML front matter
3. Clear priority (004) in the core rules category
4. No duplication
5. Easier maintenance

### **Answer to your question**

No, you don’t need `cursor-rules.md` or `.cursorrules` anymore because:
- Content is consolidated into `004-ai-development-playbook.mdc`
- The MDC format is the current standard
- The three-digit priority system is in place
- Redundant files have been removed

The new structure follows the community best practices from the [Cursor forum discussion](https://forum.cursor.com/t/my-best-practices-for-mdc-rules-and-troubleshooting/50526) and provides a clean, organized approach to managing Cursor rules.

_**User (2025-10-02 19:54Z)**_

in @ai-development-playbook.md and @implementation-guide.md , the docs talk about a few steps:

#### Step 1: Intent Capture
#### Step 2: Roadmap Creation
#### Step 3: Task Decomposition
#### Step 4: Collaborative Execution
#### Step 5: Continuous Refinement

Each of these steps has associated roles for me, for the AI, and also has deliverables and objectives. Is there anything that we should create to make moving through these steps as straightforward as possible? I'm not sure if this is the right approach, which is why I'm asking. But as one example, I could imagine for the intent capture phase, perhaps there's a cursor rule that we develop that provides very clear instructions as to what the AI's role is. And how it can facilitate achieving the objectives and deliverables outlined in that stage. What do you think about this or some other approach to make working through these phases or stages super tactical?

## Tactical phase approach implemented

Implemented a tactical approach for the 5-phase AI Development Playbook. Each phase now has dedicated Cursor rules with clear AI roles, step-by-step guidance, and ready-to-use prompts.

### **What I created**

#### **1. Phase-specific Cursor rules (101-105)**
- **101-intent-capture-phase.mdc**: AI role and instructions for Intent Capture
- **102-roadmap-creation-phase.mdc**: AI role and instructions for Roadmap Creation
- **103-task-decomposition-phase.mdc**: AI role and instructions for Task Decomposition
- **104-collaborative-execution-phase.mdc**: AI role and instructions for Collaborative Execution
- **105-continuous-refinement-phase.mdc**: AI role and instructions for Continuous Refinement

#### **2. Tactical templates and guides**
- **tactical-phase-guide.md**: Guide to using the tactical approach
- **phase-execution-template.md**: Template for executing each phase
- **Updated implementation-guide.md**: References the new tactical approach

### **How it works**

#### **Each phase now has**
1. **Clear AI role and responsibilities**
2. **4-step tactical process**
3. **Ready-to-use AI prompts**
4. **Success criteria and quality gates**
5. **Deliverables checklist**

#### **Example: Intent Capture phase**
```
AI's Role:
- Refine and clarify the intent document
- Identify potential challenges and edge cases
- Suggest improvements to problem definition
- Generate initial user stories and acceptance criteria

4-Step Process:
1. Intent Document Review
2. Problem Analysis
3. User Story Creation
4. Validation and Refinement

Ready-to-Use Prompts:
"I'm starting the Intent Capture phase for [project name]. Let me review the intent template and help you define a clear problem statement, success criteria, and user stories. What's the core problem you're trying to solve?"
```

### **Benefits**

1. **Actionable**: Each phase has specific instructions and prompts
2. **Consistent**: Standardized 4-step process across phases
3. **AI-guided**: Clear AI roles and facilitation instructions
4. **Quality-assured**: Built-in quality gates and success criteria
5. **Template-driven**: Ready-to-use templates and checklists

### **How to use**

1. **Start with the Tactical Phase Guide** — understand the approach
2. **Use phase-specific Cursor rules** — each phase has dedicated AI instructions
3. **Follow the 4-step tactical process** — consistent approach across phases
4. **Use the provided AI prompts** — guide AI collaboration
5. **Complete quality gates** — ensure phase completion before proceeding

### **Updated documentation**

- **ai-development-playbook.md**: References the tactical approach
- **implementation-guide.md**: Updated with phase-specific instructions
- **tactical-phase-guide.md**: Guide to using the tactical approach
- **phase-execution-template.md**: Template for executing each phase

This makes the 5-phase process actionable and consistent, with clear AI roles, step-by-step guidance, and quality gates.

_**User (2025-10-02 19:54Z)**_

Can compare @100-ai-feature-development.mdc to what we've documented in @playbook/ and let me know what's unique about the rules file? Don't take any action yet, I'd like to see the differences and where they overlap, then decide whether to keep what's in playbook/ or the @100-ai-feature-development.mdc rule.

---

_**Assistant (default)**_



---

### High-level
- **Overlap**: Both define a 5-phase flow, emphasize planning first, task breakdown, iterative delivery, quality gates, and human–AI roles.
- **Unique to the rule (100-ai-feature-development.mdc)**: Operational, CI/env/observability guardrails and checklists the playbook doesn’t codify.
- **Unique to the playbook (`docs/playbook/`)**: Deeper guidance, templates, phase-specific cursor rules (101–105), and tactical prompts.

### Overlap (conceptual)
- **Phases**: Plan → Tasks → Delivery → Validation → Continuous Improvement mirrors the playbook’s 5 phases.
- **Quality gates**: Both require validation before proceeding.
- **Human–AI collaboration**: Both frame AI as an active collaborator.
- **Documentation-first**: Intent/plan precede execution.

### What’s unique in 100-ai-feature-development.mdc
- **Rule semantics**
  - YAML front matter (`description`, `globs`, `alwaysApply: false`) makes it executable as a Cursor rule in-context.
  - Categorized as an “Integration Rule” that can be activated contextually; intended to guide agent behavior during feature work.
- **Branching and commit discipline**
  - Requires `feat/<short-name>` branch naming and conventional commits.
- **Vertical slice delivery pattern**
  - “Skeleton first, then fill in” to ship a runnable end-to-end path early.
- **Provider/driver configuration pattern**
  - Start with in-memory/mocked providers; expose a single `provider`/`driver` switch for production stores; gate ext. providers.
- **Environment and secrets hard guards**
  - Keep `.env.example` current; centralized config with validation; fail fast in production; never ship placeholder keys; provide `npm run setup`.
- **Observability defaults (LLM-specific)**
  - LangSmith fields: `project_name`, dynamic `run_name`, `tags`, `metadata`.
  - Minimal structured logs for key decisions/errors.
- **Streaming test hygiene**
  - Explicit instruction to drain async iterators or call `.return()`/abort to avoid open-handle leaks in CI.
- **Frontend integration guidance**
  - Reuse RN/RNW + NativeWind + gluestack UI; hide partial features behind flags/guards.
- **Retrieval/data guidance**
  - In-memory defaults, ingestion path if retrieval required.
- **Deployment**
  - Low-friction deploys, health probe, rollback plan.
- **CI specifics**
  - Run tests on PRs/pushes to `main`; start local services in background with health/port checks; require minimal secrets; output terminal logs only.
- **PR checklist (enforceable)**
  - `.env.example` updated; tests added; CI green; LangSmith traces correct; frontend guarded; environment validation passes; real API keys; setup script passes.
- **Definition of Done (crisp)**
  - E2E demoable; acceptance criteria met; tests pass locally/CI; env documented; telemetry visible; rollback noted.

### What’s unique in the playbook (docs/playbook/)
- **Depth and pedagogy**
  - Full methodology, narrative guidance, and detailed roles for each phase.
- **Phase-specific Cursor rules (operationalized facilitation)**
  - `101-intent-capture-phase.mdc`, `102-roadmap-creation-phase.mdc`, `103-task-decomposition-phase.mdc`, `104-collaborative-execution-phase.mdc`, `105-continuous-refinement-phase.mdc` with:
    - AI responsibilities, step-by-step facilitation, success criteria, deliverable checklists, and ready-to-use prompts.
- **Templates**
  - `intent-template.md`, `roadmap-template.md`, `task-breakdown-template.md`, `phase-execution-template.md`.
- **Tactical guide**
  - `tactical-phase-guide.md` explains how to apply rules/templates per phase.
- **Documentation references**
  - Updated `ai-development-playbook.md` and `implementation-guide.md` point to phase rules and templates, adding a “How to use” flow.

### Gaps surfaced (where they don’t cover each other)
- **In rule but not in playbook**
  - Branch naming convention (`feat/<short-name>`).
  - CI “services in background with health checks” and “terminal logs only” specifics.
  - LangSmith field-level requirements and “drain streams” guidance.
  - Single provider/driver configuration switch pattern, explicit low-friction deploy + health probe + rollback plan.
  - Enforceable PR checklist and crisp Definition of Done.
- **In playbook but not in rule**
  - Phase facilitation prompts and checklists (now covered by 101–105 files, not by 100).
  - Templates that create the artifacts (intent/roadmap/tasks/phase-execution).

### Recommendation (no changes yet)
- **Keep both**:
  - Use `100-ai-feature-development.mdc` as the enforceable, operational rule for feature delivery (CI/env/telemetry/PR/DoD).
  - Keep the playbook for methodology, templates, and the phase-specific facilitation rules (101–105).
- If you prefer a single source:
  - Make `100` the source of truth for CI/env/observability/PR/DoD, and keep playbook focused on phases, templates, and prompts, linking back to `100` for guardrails.

_**User (2025-10-02 19:54Z)**_

Ok let's keep what you think are the best elements of each of these. Please describe each of their purposes and how they relate to each other. Keeping the notion of "continuous improvement" is very important to me thorughout our playbook and tactics.

- @playbook/ 
- @100-ai-feature-development.mdc 
- @004-ai-development-playbook.mdc

_**Assistant (default)**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Structuring the Response**

I should focus on a concise answer without taking any actions. I want to clarify purposes and relationships while selecting the best elements. Continuous improvement will be a key notion.  

**Formatting Considerations**  
Instead of using code, I’ll use bold pseudo headings in a markdown format.  

**References**  
I’ll consider including references without needing to link to any websites, and I’ll ensure everything stays clear and concise.</details></think>

### Purpose and relationship

- **playbook/**
  - Purpose: Narrative guide + tactical assets. Explains the 5-phase method, gives ready-to-use templates, and phase-specific Cursor rules (101–105) with prompts, checklists, success criteria.
  - Relationship: Human-facing “how” and “why.” It teaches the process, scaffolds artifacts, and operationalizes facilitation per phase.

- **100-ai-feature-development.mdc**
  - Purpose: Enforceable delivery guardrails for a single feature’s lifecycle (Plan → Tasks → Delivery → Validation → Continuous Improvement).
  - Relationship: Agent-facing execution rule that activates during feature work; provides CI/env/observability/PR/DoD requirements and vertical-slice delivery patterns.

- **004-ai-development-playbook.mdc**
  - Purpose: Core conduct baseline across the repo (structure, code quality, testing, security, collaboration), independent of any specific feature.
  - Relationship: Always-on foundation that governs behavior; the “floor” all work must meet. 100 builds on it; playbook extends it with phase tactics.

### Keep the best of each

- **From playbook/**
  - Templates: `intent-template.md`, `roadmap-template.md`, `task-breakdown-template.md`, `phase-execution-template.md`.
  - Phase rules: `101–105` with AI roles, 4-step process, prompts, deliverables, quality gates.
  - Tactical guides: “Tactical Phase Guide,” updated “Implementation Guide” with phase-driven flow.

- **From 100-ai-feature-development.mdc**
  - Delivery patterns: “Skeleton first → end-to-end vertical slice,” branch naming `feat/<short-name>`, conventional commits.
  - Environment/Secrets: `.env.example` kept current, centralized config, fail-fast in prod, never ship placeholders, `npm run setup`.
  - Observability: LangSmith fields (project_name, dynamic run_name, tags, metadata), minimal structured logs.
  - Streaming hygiene: drain iterators/abort to avoid CI open-handle leaks.
  - CI rules: background services with health/port checks, minimal secrets, terminal logs only.
  - Retrieval/data: in-memory default, single provider/driver switch, ingestion path.
  - PR checklist + crisp DoD.

- **From 004-ai-development-playbook.mdc**
  - Baseline engineering standards: TypeScript-first, error handling, testing norms, security, performance, documentation, collaboration, version control.
  - Evergreen quality gates: compile clean, tests pass, lint/format, docs updated.

### How they fit together (layered model)

- **Foundation (004)**: Always-on baseline (quality, security, testing, collaboration). Applies to all work.
- **Feature delivery (100)**: Enforceable execution rule for shipping vertical slices with CI/env/telemetry/PR/DoD guardrails. Applies when building a feature.
- **Tactics and artifacts (playbook/)**: Human-facing guidance, phase-specific AI facilitation, templates, and checklists to actually produce the artifacts and move phases forward.

### Continuous improvement (woven through all three)

- **In playbook/**: “Continuous Refinement” phase (rule 105) with AI prompts, success metrics, and checklists; “Tactical Phase Guide” encourages iteration; templates capture lessons learned.
- **In 100**: Explicit “CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT” section; PR checklist/DoD enforce feedback loops; telemetry guides measurement and learning.
- **In 004**: Collaboration and documentation norms (update docs, explain decisions, refine patterns) create a baseline habit of improvement.

### Practical use (day-to-day)

- **Start** with playbook templates and phase rules (101–105) to drive Intent → Roadmap → Tasks.
- **Build** under 004 (baseline) + 100 (delivery guardrails) to ship a vertical slice safely.
- **Validate** with 100’s CI/PR/DoD; measure via LangSmith; apply 105 for refinement.
- **Evolve** templates/rules as you learn; update 004/100 minimally to reflect proven improvements.

_**User (2025-10-02 19:54Z)**_

Ok, the above looks great! Are there any changes we need to make the files (@playbook/ , @100-ai-feature-development.mdc , @004-ai-development-playbook.mdc ) to implement this?

---

_**Assistant (default)**_

Looking at the current state and the layered model we described, here are the specific changes needed:

## Changes Required

### 1. **100-ai-feature-development.mdc** - Add missing elements
**Add references to playbook artifacts:**
- Update the PLANNING (Task) section to reference the intent template: `Use docs/playbook/templates/intent-template.md`
- Reference the roadmap template: `Use docs/playbook/templates/roadmap-template.md`
- Reference the task-breakdown template: `Use docs/playbook/templates/task-breakdown-template.md`

**Expand the CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT section:**
- Add reference<｜tool▁call▁begin｜>

# 🧭 AI Feature Development: End-to-End Workflow (Integration Rules)

## 🎯 Purpose
A zoomed-out, repeatable workflow that organizes AI-assisted development from idea to shipped feature, while preserving concrete best practices.

**Applies to**: Any feature (UI, agent/graph, retrieval, API, infra), across web/mobile/backends.

## 📋 The 5-Phase Process

### 1) PLAN (Research → Feature Plan)
- **Discovery**: Use AI chat to explore problem/market, constraints, risks. Save key notes in `documentation/projects/<vN: feature-name>/`.
- **Feature plan (must-have)**:
  - Problem statement and user value
  - Primary user story + 3–5 acceptance criteria
  - Constraints (performance, platform, data, a11y, privacy)
  - Telemetry plan (LangSmith, analytics, logs)
  - Out-of-scope/not-now
- **Review**: sanity-check with AI; clarify unknowns; confirm the vertical slice to ship first.
- **🗂️ Template**: Use `docs/playbook/templates/intent-template.md` for structured intent capture with AI facilitation.

### 2) TASKS (Project Breakdown → Story-Organized Todo List)
- **Branch**: `feat/<short-name>`; use conventional commits.
- **Work plan (must-have)**: Story-oriented task list with subtasks mapping to acceptance criteria.
  - Mark dependencies, mocks vs real integrations, and risks.
- **🗂️ Templates**: Use `docs/playbook/templates/roadmap-template.md` and `docs/playbook/templates/task-breakdown-template.md` for structured planning with AI collaboration.
- **Scaffolding**: Prefer templates and stubs to get to runnable fast.
- After major task(s), prove to me that the task(s) is complete.

### 3) DELIVERY (Build the Vertical Slice → Iterate)
- **Skeleton first, then fill in**: ship a runnable end-to-end path early.
  - Prefer in-memory/mocked providers first; gate external providers (DBs/vector stores/LLMs) behind a `provider`/`driver` config with safe defaults for local dev.
- **Configuration & Secrets**:
  - Keep `.env.example` current.
  - Centralize config (e.g., `agent/src/config/index.ts`), validate required keys.
  - Never leak secrets; use repository secrets in CI.
  - **🚨 CRITICAL**: Validate environment at startup; warn if running in mock mode.
  - **🚨 CRITICAL**: Never ship services with placeholder API keys (`'test-key'`, `'your_api_key_here'`).
  - **🚨 CRITICAL**: Provide automated environment setup scripts (`npm run setup`).
  - **🚨 CRITICAL**: Fail fast in production if critical configuration is missing.
- **Observability by default** (if LLMs):
  - LangSmith: set `project_name`, dynamic `run_name`, `tags`, `metadata` per run/test.
  - Minimal structured logs for key decisions/errors.
  - If streaming APIs are used, ensure callers drain streams or explicitly cancel (AbortSignal/`.return()`); do not break iterators early in tests.
- **Frontend integration (if applicable)**:
  - Reuse patterns/components; RN/RNW + NativeWind + gluestack UI; a11y.
  - Hide incomplete features behind flags/guards.
- **Retrieval/Data (if applicable)**:
  - Start with in-memory implementations by default for local dev and tests.
  - Expose a single `provider`/`driver` switch with env-based configuration for production stores.
  - Provide an ingestion (indexer) path if retrieval is required.
- **Deployment**:
  - Favor low-friction deploys first; document required env.
  - Provide a simple health probe and rollback plan.

### 4) VALIDATION (Test → CI → Ship → Measure)
- **Tests (must-have)**:
  - Jest tests per story: happy path, error handling, timing sanity bound.
  - Fast by default; prefer in-memory/mocks.
  - For streaming clients, drain async iterators (or call `.return()`/abort signals) to avoid open-handle leaks in CI.
- **CI rules**:
  - Run tests on PRs to `main` and on pushes to `main`.
  - Start local services in background with health or port checks.
  - Require only the minimal secrets needed for the default provider (e.g., a single LLM key); external providers optional.
  - Output only terminal logs.
- **LangSmith/Telemetry**:
  - Confirm traces show dynamic run names, tags, and metadata.
  - Capture minimal KPIs defined in the plan.
- **Release**:
  - Merge when CI green and acceptance criteria met.
  - Announce change and update docs.

### 5) CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT
- **Reflection & Templates**:
  - Use `docs/playbook/templates/phase-execution-template.md` to track improvements and lessons learned.
  - Document what worked well and what didn't in each phase.
  - Update templates based on experience and findings.
- **Cursor Rules**:
  - Reflect on feature development and update cursor rules in ways that generalize to and streamline future feature development.
  - Apply lessons learned to phase-specific rules (101-105) and core rules (004).
- **Documentation**:
  - Reflect on feature development and update general or feature-specific docs with the most accurate and up-to-date information.
  - Share improvements with team and broader community.
- **Process Enhancement**:
  - Identify bottlenecks and inefficiencies in the current workflow.
  - Propose and test improvements to templates, checklists, and quality gates.

## 📋 Templates & Checklists

### Templates (recommended)
- Scaffold for feature/agent with code + test + docs.

### PR Checklist
- [ ] Feature plan and `.env.example` updated
- [ ] Tests added and passing locally
- [ ] CI green
- [ ] LangSmith traces correct (if LLMs)
- [ ] Frontend guarded if partial
- [ ] **🚨 Environment validation**: Services start without mock mode warnings
- [ ] **🚨 Configuration check**: All API keys are real, not placeholders
- [ ] **🚨 Setup validation**: `npm run setup` passes without errors

## 🎯 Definition of Done
- End-to-end demoable; acceptance criteria met.
- Tests pass locally and in CI.
- Env documented; secrets configured.
- Telemetry visible; rollback noted.

## ✅ Changes Complete

I've successfully made all the requested changes to integrate the layered model across the three components:

### **100-ai-feature-development.mdc** changes:
1. **Added template references** in PLAN and TASKS phases:
   - References `docs/playbook/templates/intent-template.md` for structured intent capture
   - References `docs/playbook/templates/roadmap-template.md` and `docs/playbook/templates/task-breakdown-template.md` for structured planning

2. **Enhanced CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT section**:
   - Added **Reflection & Templates** subsection with phase-execution-template.md reference
   - Added **Process Enhancement** subsection for identifying bottlenecks and testing improvements
   - Expanded **Cursor Rules** to reference lessons learned flowing back to phase-specific rules (101-105) and core rules (004)

### **004-ai-development-playbook.mdc** changes:
1. **Added continuous improvement integration**:
   - Document and Communication section now includes "Apply continuous improvement practices from the AI Development Playbook"
   - Iterative Development section now includes "Follow the 5-phase AI Development Playbook process when appropriate"

### **docs/playbook/** changes:
1. **ai-development-playbook.md**:
   - Added "Integration with Feature Development" section explaining how playbook phases work with 100 rule
   - Added "Continuous Improvement Integration" section showing how improvements flow across all rule layers

2. **tactical-phase-guide.md**:
   - Added "Integration with Feature Development Rules" section explaining the rule hierarchy
   - Clarified how Core Rules (004), Feature Rules (100), and Phase Rules (101-105) work together

### **Result**: 
Now you have a **cohesive, layered system** where:
- **004** provides the foundational quality floor
- **100** operationalizes feature delivery with hard guardrails
- **Playbook/101-105** provides tactical phase execution with templates and AI facilitation
- **Continuous improvement** flows across all layers, from lessons learned in specific phases up through template updates to foundational practice improvements

The system maintains your emphasis on continuous improvement throughout while clearly defining each component's purpose and their relationships.

_**User (2025-10-02 19:54Z)**_

Ok so please give me a quick recap. I'd like to start planning out a "deploy" project where I deploy the latest code to a production website (e.g. chefchopsky.com). How would I use what we've built in this conversation to get started on that?

---

_**Assistant (default)**_

## Quick recap: what we built

### **Layered rule system**
- **004-ai-development-playbook.mdc**: Foundation (quality, security, testing)
- **100-ai-feature-development.mdc**: Feature delivery (CI, env, observability, vertical slices)
- **101-105 phase rules**: Tactical AI facilitation for each phase
- **Playbook templates**: Intent, roadmap, task breakdown, phase execution

### **5-phase process**
1. **Intent Capture** → Define the problem and success criteria
2. **Roadmap Creation** → Break into phases with milestones
3. **Task Decomposition** → Actionable tasks with ownership
4. **Collaborative Execution** → Build with AI-human collaboration
5. **Continuous Refinement** → Iterate based on feedback

## How to start your "deploy" project

### **Step 1: Intent Capture (use 101 rule)**
```
"I'm starting the Intent Capture phase for the 'deploy' project. Let me review the intent template and help you define a clear problem statement, success criteria, and user stories. What's the core problem you're trying to solve?"
```

**Use**: `docs/playbook/templates/intent-template.md`
- Problem: Deploy latest code to chefchopsky.com
- Success criteria: Automated, reliable, zero-downtime deployment
- Constraints: Production environment, rollback capability, monitoring

### **Step 2: Roadmap Creation (use 102 rule)**
```
"I'm starting the Roadmap Creation phase. Let me analyze your user stories and help you create a logical phase breakdown with clear dependencies, risks, and resource allocation. What's your target timeline and available resources?"
```

**Use**: `docs/playbook/templates/roadmap-template.md`
- Phase 1: Infrastructure setup (CI/CD pipeline)
- Phase 2: Deployment automation (scripts, configs)
- Phase 3: Monitoring & rollback (health checks, alerts)
- Phase 4: Testing & validation (staging, production tests)

### **Step 3: Task Decomposition (use 103 rule)**
```
"I'm starting the Task Decomposition phase. Let me break down your phase objectives into specific, actionable tasks with clear ownership assignments. I'll analyze each task for complexity and recommend the best human vs AI approach."
```

**Use**: `docs/playbook/templates/task-breakdown-template.md`
- AI tasks: Write deployment scripts, set up CI configs, create monitoring
- Human tasks: Infrastructure decisions, security review, production validation

### **Step 4: Collaborative Execution (use 104 rule)**
```
"I'm starting the Collaborative Execution phase for [task name]. Let me analyze the requirements and create a high-quality implementation that meets the acceptance criteria. I'll follow the established coding standards and include comprehensive testing."
```

**Follow 100 rule guardrails**:
- Branch: `feat/deploy-automation`
- Vertical slice: Get basic deployment working first
- Environment validation: Never ship placeholder keys
- Observability: LangSmith traces, structured logs

### **Step 5: Continuous Refinement (use 105 rule)**
```
"I'm starting the Continuous Refinement phase. Let me analyze the feedback and suggestions, implement the required changes, and optimize the implementation for better performance and quality."
```

## Getting started right now

1. Copy `docs/playbook/templates/intent-template.md` to `docs/projects/deploy/intent.md`
2. Use the 101-intent-capture-phase.mdc rule to guide AI facilitation
3. Follow the 4-step tactical process defined in the phase rule
4. Use the provided AI prompts to guide collaboration

The system provides:

_**User (2025-10-02 19:54Z)**_

Keeping this conversation in mind and looking at our playbook, I'm curious if we can take a step back and talk through: What are the real-world human roles that would take place in each of these phases? No need to write any code or documentation; I'm just curious to know what those real-world human roles would be (e.g. product manager, junior engineer, designer, software architect, etc.). Whatever else you can think of

---

_**Assistant (default)**_

## Real-world human roles in each phase

### **Phase 1: Intent Capture**
**Primary human roles:**
- **Product Manager** — problem definition, user needs, success criteria
- **Business Stakeholder/Founder** — vision, constraints, non-goals
- **User Researcher** — personas, JTBD, validation
- **Domain Expert** — context, constraints, edge cases

**Supporting roles:**
- **Designer** — user experience and constraints
- **Sales/Marketing** — market validation and positioning
- **Legal/Compliance** — regulatory and risk constraints

### **Phase 2: Roadmap Creation**
**Primary human roles:**
- **Product Manager** — prioritization, sequencing, dependencies
- **Engineering Manager** — capacity, skills, timeline
- **Software Architect** — technical dependencies and risks
- **Business Stakeholder** — budget, timeline, business priorities

**Supporting roles:**
- **DevOps/Platform Engineer** — infrastructure and deployment
- **QA Manager** — testing strategy and quality gates
- **Design Lead** — design system and UX dependencies

### **Phase 3: Task Decomposition**
**Primary human roles:**
- **Senior Engineer/Architect** — technical breakdown and complexity
- **Engineering Manager** — resource allocation and skill matching
- **Product Manager** — acceptance criteria and business validation
- **Tech Lead** — implementation approach and standards

**Supporting roles:**
- **Junior/Mid-level Engineer** — task sizing and feasibility
- **DevOps Engineer** — deployment and infrastructure tasks
- **QA Engineer** — testing strategy and automation

### **Phase 4: Collaborative Execution**
**Primary human roles:**
- **Senior Engineer** — architecture, complex logic, code review
- **Product Manager** — acceptance criteria, user stories, feedback
- **Engineering Manager** — progress, blockers, resource allocation
- **Tech Lead** — code quality, standards, mentoring

**Supporting roles:**
- **Junior/Mid-level Engineer** — implementation, testing, documentation
- **Designer** — UI/UX implementation and validation
- **QA Engineer** — testing, bug reports, quality validation
- **DevOps Engineer** — deployment, monitoring, infrastructure

### **Phase 5: Continuous Refinement**
**Primary human roles:**
- **Product Manager** — feedback, prioritization, iteration planning
- **Senior Engineer** — performance, architecture, technical debt
- **Engineering Manager** — process improvement, team learning
- **User Researcher** — user feedback, validation, insights

**Supporting roles:**
- **QA Engineer** — quality metrics, testing improvements
- **DevOps Engineer** — performance monitoring, infrastructure optimization
- **Designer** — UX improvements, design system updates

## Solo entrepreneur reality

### **You wear multiple hats:**
- **Product Manager** + **Business Stakeholder** + **Domain Expert**
- **Software Architect** + **Senior Engineer** + **Tech Lead**
- **Engineering Manager** + **DevOps Engineer** + **QA Engineer**
- **Designer** + **User Researcher** + **Marketing**

### **AI as your team:**
- **Junior Engineer** — implementation, testing, documentation
- **Research Assistant** — market research, competitive analysis
- **Technical Writer** — documentation, specifications
- **Code Reviewer** — quality checks, best practices
- **Project Coordinator** — task tracking, progress updates

## Role distribution by phase

### **High human involvement:**
- **Intent Capture** — vision, strategy, business decisions
- **Roadmap Creation** — prioritization, resource planning
- **Continuous Refinement** — feedback, iteration, learning

### **High AI involvement:**
- **Task Decomposition** — technical breakdown, implementation planning
- **Collaborative Execution** — coding, testing, documentation

### **Balanced collaboration:**
- **All phases** — AI provides analysis, suggestions, and execution support
- **Human provides** — judgment, creativity, strategic decisions
- **AI provides** — research, implementation, optimization

## Takeaway

The playbook supports a solo founder by:
1. **Clarifying roles** — when to be PM vs architect vs engineer
2. **Leveraging AI** — as a capable team member for execution
3. **Maintaining quality** — through structured processes and checkpoints
4. **Enabling scale** — systematic approach that grows with the business

The phase-specific rules help you switch contexts and collaborate with AI effectively.

_**User (2025-10-02 19:54Z)**_

In the tactical version of this playbook, is there an opportunity to more crisply break down or include the actual human real-world roles within the tactics? For example, would it make sense to articulate that in the phase II cursor rule, the AI should be wearing the hats of:
1. Product Manager
2. Engineering Manager
3. Software Architect
4. Business Stakeholder

What do you think?

---

_**Assistant (default)**_

## Why this helps

### **Current state**
- Phase rules are generic (“AI’s role”)
- No explicit human role context
- Easy to lose track of which hat to wear

### **With role-specific guidance**
- Clear context for each phase
- AI can prompt the right mindset
- More realistic collaboration
- Better decision-making

## Proposed role breakdown by phase

### **Phase 1: Intent Capture (101 rule)**
**Human roles:**
- **Product Manager** — problem definition, user needs
- **Business Stakeholder** — vision, constraints, success criteria
- **Domain Expert** — context, edge cases, assumptions

**AI prompts:**
```
"As a Product Manager, help me define the core problem statement and user value proposition. What questions should I be asking about target users and their pain points?"
```

### **Phase 2: Roadmap Creation (102 rule)**
**Human roles:**
- **Product Manager** — prioritization, sequencing, dependencies
- **Engineering Manager** — resource allocation, timeline, capacity
- **Software Architect** — technical dependencies, risks, approach
- **Business Stakeholder** — budget, timeline, business priorities

**AI prompts:**
```
"As an Engineering Manager, help me assess the technical complexity and resource requirements for each phase. What are the critical path dependencies I should be aware of?"
```

### **Phase 3: Task Decomposition (103 rule)**
**Human roles:**
- **Senior Engineer/Architect** — technical breakdown, complexity
- **Engineering Manager** — resource allocation, skill matching
- **Tech Lead** — implementation approach, standards
- **Product Manager** — acceptance criteria, business validation

**AI prompts:**
```
"As a Senior Engineer, help me break down this feature into specific, implementable tasks. What are the technical dependencies and complexity factors I should consider?"
```

### **Phase 4: Collaborative Execution (104 rule)**
**Human roles:**
- **Senior Engineer** — architecture, complex logic, code review
- **Product Manager** — acceptance criteria, user stories, feedback
- **Engineering Manager** — progress, blockers, resource allocation
- **Tech Lead** — code quality, standards, mentoring

**AI prompts:**
```
"As a Senior Engineer, help me implement this feature following best practices. What architectural decisions should I make, and how should I structure the code for maintainability?"
```

### **Phase 5: Continuous Refinement (105 rule)**
**Human roles:**
- **Product Manager** — feedback, prioritization, iteration planning
- **Senior Engineer** — performance, architecture, technical debt
- **Engineering Manager** — process improvement, team learning
- **User Researcher** — user feedback, validation, insights

**AI prompts:**
```
"As a Product Manager, help me analyze the user feedback and prioritize improvements. What metrics should I track, and how should I plan the next iteration?"
```

## Implementation approach

### **Update each phase rule (101-105)**
1. Add a “Human roles” section with the roles for that phase
2. Include role-specific AI prompts
3. Add context switching guidance
4. Provide decision-making frameworks per role

### **Example: Enhanced 102 rule structure**
```markdown
## Human Roles in This Phase
**Primary Roles:**
- **Product Manager**: Prioritization, sequencing, dependencies
- **Engineering Manager**: Resource allocation, timeline, capacity
- **Software Architect**: Technical dependencies, risks, approach
- **Business Stakeholder**: Budget, timeline, business priorities

## Role-Specific AI Facilitation

### Product Manager Context
**AI Prompt**: "As a Product Manager, help me prioritize these user stories and create a logical phase sequence. What dependencies should I consider, and how should I balance user value with technical complexity?"

### Engineering Manager Context
**AI Prompt**: "As an Engineering Manager, help me assess resource requirements and timeline estimates. What are the critical path items, and how should I allocate human vs AI tasks?"

### Software Architect Context
**AI Prompt**: "As a Software Architect, help me identify technical dependencies and risks. What architectural decisions should I make now, and what can be deferred?"
```

## Benefits

### **For solo entrepreneurs**
- Clear context switching
- Better decision-making
- More realistic collaboration
- Systematic approach

### **For AI collaboration**
- Role-aware prompts
- Context-specific guidance
- Better suggestions
- More effective facilitation

## Recommendation

Update the phase rules (101-105) to include:
1. **Human roles** for each phase
2. **Role-specific AI prompts**
3. **Context switching guidance**
4. **Decision-making frameworks**

This makes the playbook more tactical and realistic for solo entrepreneurs working with AI.

## Changes complete

Updated all phase rules (101–105) with role-specific guidance and added documentation.

### **Phase rules updated (101–105)**

Each rule now includes:
- **Human roles** for that phase
- **Role-specific AI prompts** for different contexts
- **Context switching guidance** for solo entrepreneurs
- **Decision-making frameworks** for each role

### **New documentation**

**`docs/playbook/human-roles-by-phase.md`** includes:
- Role breakdown by phase
- Solo entrepreneur reality (wearing multiple hats)
- AI as team member
- Role distribution by phase
- Context switching guidance
- Benefits of a role-aware approach

### **Updated references**

- **ai-development-playbook.md**: Added reference to human-roles-by-phase.md
- **README.md**: Added human-roles-by-phase.md to core documentation

### **Benefits**

1. Clear context switching between mindsets
2. Role-aware AI prompts
3. More realistic collaboration
4. Systematic approach to wearing multiple hats

### **Example: Enhanced 102 rule**

Now includes:
- **Human roles**: Product Manager, Engineering Manager, Software Architect, Business Stakeholder
- **Role-specific prompts**: "As a Product Manager, help me prioritize these user stories..."
- **Context guidance**: When to switch between roles
- **Decision frameworks**: Role-specific considerations

The playbook is now more tactical and realistic for solo entrepreneurs working with AI.
