_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Structuring the Vision**

I'm currently focused on extracting the sections from `vision.md`. My plan is to create individual files in a directory named "product". Each new file will correspond to a specific section, starting with "üåü Vision" and followed by "‚úÖ ". I'm thinking about how to programmatically identify these sections based on the markdown formatting.


**Analyzing Section Boundaries**

I've made good progress! I've read `vision.md` and I'm now focusing on how to programmatically identify the section boundaries. I'm thinking of using the markdown headers (e.g., `## üåü Vision`) as keys to split the content. I am creating individual files within the `product` directory, and each file will house a corresponding section of `vision.md`.


**Refining File Naming**

I'm now determining how to name the product files. I'm focusing on preserving the original markdown structure, possibly removing special characters from the headers and using a consistent format for the file names to ensure clarity and organization. I'm confident I can do this efficiently now.


**Creating Section Files**

I'm now implementing the file creation process. I'm focusing on the first four sections, starting with "Vision," "Value Proposition," "Jobs To Be Done," and "Scenarios." I've created the `product` directory and I'm generating individual files, each containing the content corresponding to its section. The goal is to accurately represent each section as a separate file.


**Refining Section Extraction**

I'm now focusing on efficiently extracting and writing the remaining sections to their individual files. I've successfully created the directory and the first four files. I'm leveraging Python to read `vision.md`, parse each section using the headers, and write it to its own file within the "product" directory. I am looking into how to automate the naming of these files now.


**Expanding File Creation**

I've successfully created the files for the first four sections and am now expanding my approach to include the "Feature Library" and "Additional Planning Elements" sections. I am structuring the information and aiming to preserve the markdown structure as much as possible, while maintaining a clear and organized file structure. I plan to put sub-sections into a single file to reflect this organization.


**Implementing File Generation**

I've now successfully split `vision.md` into seven markdown files within the `product` directory, with each file corresponding to one of the original sections. I'm satisfied with the clarity and organization of the files. I'm now examining how to create these files dynamically in the future.


**Automating File Generation**

I'm now fully immersed in the automation of file creation. I've read and understood the entire file structure. I plan to use Python to dynamically generate the files. I'm focusing on parsing the original content, extracting the sections based on their headers, and creating individual files in the "product" directory with the appropriate content.


**Refining File Generation**

I'm currently automating the file creation process. My approach now centers on splitting `vision.md` based on headers and creating corresponding files within the "product" directory. I am working to streamline section extraction using Python, making sure each section of the markdown becomes a new file with the appropriate content.


**Initiating Section Separation**

I'm now fully immersed in dissecting `vision.md` into separate markdown files within the "product" directory. I am using Python and regex to automate section splitting based on headers, followed by file creation. Each new file will contain a segment of the original content. I have initiated file creation.


**Finalizing File Structure**

Now, I've concluded the process of creating the individual section files in the "product" directory. I have read the original content of `vision.md` and created seven separate files, each containing a distinct section and its associated content, reflecting the user's intent to break down the original document into these separate, clearly defined files. The files were structured according to the markdown formatting. This is the conclusion of my task.


**Initiating File Separation**

I'm now fully committed to separating `vision.md` into distinct files in the `product` directory.  I've devised a clear plan for using Python and regular expressions to automate section splitting, making it easy to create and name each file.  I'm making sure that each section's corresponding markdown content is included in its own file.


**Refining the Implementation**

I'm now fully immersed in creating individual markdown files for each section in the `product` directory. Using the markdown provided, I've created all the necessary files with their respective content. My current focus is on double-checking the accuracy of each file and ensuring they're correctly formatted according to the specifications.

Of course. I'll break down the `vision.md` file into separate files for each section and place them in a new `product` directory. First, I'll create the new directory.

For each of the elements in @planning-elements.md , can you further break those down into separate files and (if needed) write a basic draft of that file leveraging the other content in the @/product folder?

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Analyzing the File Structure**

I'm currently focused on breaking down the `product/planning-elements.md` file. The goal is to create individual files for Personas, Brand Voice & UX Personality, Success Metrics, Platform Strategy, and Revenue Model. I'm exploring the best approach to extract and structure this information effectively.


**Structuring the Elements**

I've examined `product/planning-elements.md` and identified the key elements as requested. My next step is to create individual files for each element and generate initial drafts using the existing content and related files in the product folder.  I'm now determining the most logical way to structure the new files.


**Expanding on the Personas**

I've begun drafting the `product/personas.md` file. I'm expanding on the personas from `planning-elements.md`, including details from `jobs-to-be-done.md` and `scenarios.md` to give a fuller picture of each user group. I'm focusing on the "Athletic couples" persona first, and will then move on to the other three groups. The goal is to provide rich, data-driven personas for the product development team. I'm evaluating the content in the other product files to determine the best approach.


**Expanding the Drafts**

I've moved on to the next set of tasks and am now drafting `product/personas.md`. I'm using the information from `planning-elements.md`, `jobs-to-be-done.md`, `scenarios.md`, and `feature-library.md` to create more detailed profiles. For instance, I'm analyzing "Athletic Couples" to flesh out their needs and goals based on related content. I'm taking the initial points and fleshing them out with related information.


**Drafting the New Files**

I've completed initial drafts for `product/personas.md`, `product/brand.md`, and `product/success-metrics.md`. I've detailed the personas using information from `jobs-to-be-done.md`, `scenarios.md`, and `feature-library.md`. I've also expanded the Brand Voice and outlined the metrics and their significance. The next step will be to create and complete the Platform Strategy and Revenue Model files.


**Expanding the Elements**

I'm now writing initial drafts for the new files. I've focused on `product/personas.md` (detailing each persona with data from `jobs-to-be-done.md`, `scenarios.md`, and `feature-library.md`), `product/brand.md` (expanding on the "Chopsky the coach" personality), and `product/success-metrics.md` (defining each metric and its significance).


**Developing the Initial Files**

I'm making strong progress on the new files. I've finished the initial drafts of `personas.md`, `brand.md`, and `success-metrics.md`. I used data from `jobs-to-be-done.md`, `scenarios.md`, and `feature-library.md` to enhance the persona descriptions.  I defined and explained each of the metrics outlined and explained how to measure them. I'm now developing the outlines for the revenue model and platform strategy files.


**Developing a Detailed Plan**

I'm now fully immersed in the creation process. My approach involves extracting key elements from `planning-elements.md` to establish five distinct files. I plan to construct drafts for `product/personas.md`, `product/brand.md`, `product/success-metrics.md`, `product/platform-strategy.md`, and `product/revenue-model.md`. This is informed by a thorough review of existing product documentation. This will involve detailing the content from the original elements.


**Developing Separate File Drafts**

I'm now generating initial drafts for the requested files. Specifically, I'm focusing on `personas.md`, `brand.md`, `success-metrics.md`, `platform-strategy.md`, and `revenue-model.md`. My strategy involves extracting the original content and then enriching it with details from other product documentation. The goal is to create comprehensive, standalone files that encapsulate each planning element. I'm now writing the first draft of the `personas.md` file.

**Structuring the Personas**

I'm making progress on the first new file, `product/personas.md`. I've begun crafting in-depth profiles for each persona, leveraging information from `jobs-to-be-done.md`, `scenarios.md`, and `feature-library.md`. For example, I'm analyzing the needs and behaviors of the "Athletic Couple" persona in more detail. I'm focusing on their key Jobs to Be Done and exploring how Chopsky can help them. I'm in the process of finalizing that persona, but I'm looking forward to expanding on the others.


**Expanding the File Creation**

I'm now fully immersed in the creation process, focusing on generating the five new files as outlined. For `personas.md`, I'm crafting detailed profiles, referencing insights from `jobs-to-be-done.md`, `scenarios.md`, and `feature-library.md` to enrich each user description. The "Athletic Couple" now includes more specific needs and behaviors gleaned from these sources. Next, I plan to move on to `brand.md` and complete the process.


**Structuring the New Files**

I'm working on the initial drafts of the new files. I'm focusing on "Athletic Couples" in `personas.md`, using insights from `jobs-to-be-done.md`, `scenarios.md`, and `feature-library.md`. I've detailed their need for high-protein meals and efficiency. Next, I plan to move on to "CSA Subscriber." I've added a section for the "Batch-cooking parents" persona. I'm taking the initial points and fleshing them out with more information.

Of course. I will break down `product/planning-elements.md` into separate files for each section. I'll create a new file for each of the following: Personas, Brand Voice, Success Metrics, Platform Strategy, and Revenue Model.

To make these new documents more useful, I'll write a brief draft for each one, elaborating on the bullet points by referencing the other product documents you've already created, such as the feature library and user scenarios.

I'll start by creating the new file for your user personas.

+ # üé® Brand Voice & UX Personality
+ 
+ This document defines the personality of Chef Chopsky. It's not just what the assistant does, but how it feels to interact with.
+ 
+ - **Core Identity:** Your smart, funny, and highly capable AI prep chef.
+ 
+ ---
+ 
+ ### Guiding Principles
+ 
+ #### 1. Friendly, Funny, and Helpful
+ The assistant should be approachable and encouraging. The humor is witty and dry, never silly or distracting. It's like cooking with a friend who is great in the kitchen and doesn't take themselves too seriously.
+ 
+ - **Example - Teaching:** "The fastest way to chop an onion? First, tell it a sad story. Just kidding. Grab a sharp knife and let's go‚Äîno tears, I promise."
+ - **Example - Encouragement:** "You liked the roasted chickpeas, nice! Want to get wild and try crispy tofu this week?"
+ 
+ #### 2. Structured & High-Utility
+ For core tasks like meal planning and prep, the UX is clean, clear, and efficient. It provides information when the user needs it, minimizing cognitive load. The structure gives the user confidence that they are on the right track.
+ 
+ - **Example - UI:** A generated meal plan is presented as a simple, scannable card list.
+ - **Example - Prep:** Prep instructions are optimized and clearly numbered, not just a wall of text.
+ 
+ #### 3. A Sprinkle of Joy
+ While the app is primarily about utility, it should also spark moments of delight. This turns a chore into a more enjoyable habit. "Chopsky the coach" is a core part of this, acting as a guide on the user's culinary journey.
+ 
+ - **Example - Quest:** Unlocking a "Master the Sheet Pan!" achievement after successfully cooking several sheet pan dinners.
+ - **Example - Voice:** Using a warm, encouraging tone for "Hey Chopsky, what's next?"

+ ---
+ 
+ ### Core Product Metrics
+ 
+ #### 1. Meals Prepped Per Week
+ This is the primary measure of our core value delivery. Are users successfully planning and prepping meals with the app?
+ - **How to measure:** Track the completion of weekly meal plans or the number of recipes marked as "cooked."
+ 
+ #### 2. Retention Rate (Weekly)
+ This measures habit formation. Are users consistently coming back each week to plan their meals? High retention is the strongest signal of a valuable product.
+ - **How to measure:** Calculate the percentage of users who are active on a week-over-week basis.
+ 
+ #### 3. Feedback Volume & Sentiment
+ This measures user engagement and helps us learn. A high volume of feedback (ratings, notes) indicates an engaged user base that is invested in helping the product improve.
+ - **How to measure:** Count the number of feedback events logged per user; analyze notes for positive/negative sentiment. This is directly tied to the **Feedback Flow** scenario.
+ 
+ ---
+ 
+ ### Feature-Specific Metrics
+ 
+ #### 4. Grocery List Generation
+ This tracks the usage of a key planning feature that bridges the gap between the meal plan and the grocery store.
+ - **How to measure:** Track the number of times the grocery list is generated or exported.
+ 
+ #### 5. Skill Improvement Over Time
+ This measures our success in making users more confident in the kitchen. It's a leading indicator of long-term value and retention.
+ - **How to measure:**
+     - Track engagement with **Teach Me Mode** and skill-based content.
+     - Monitor progress through **Cook Skill-Building Quests.**
+     - Potentially use user surveys to gauge self-reported confidence.

+     - Meal plan generation
+     - Grocery list output
+ 
+ ### Phase 2: Build a Standalone App
+ 
+ - **Platform:** Mobile/Web Application
+ - **Goal:** Create a rich, dedicated user experience that moves beyond the limitations of a chatbot. This is where we introduce interactive cooking features and deeper personalization.
+ - **Key Features to Introduce:**
+     - **Cooking Assistant:** Step-by-step mode with timers, voice commands, and prep-order optimizers.
+     - **Learning & Improvement:** Personal cookbook, smart nudges, and skill-building quests.
+     - **UI/UX:** A purpose-built interface for managing recipes, plans, and feedback.
+ 
+ ### Phase 3: Expand and Integrate
+ 
+ - **Platform:** API integrations and browser extensions.
+ - **Goal:** Meet users where they are and seamlessly integrate into their existing workflows. This phase focuses on growth and making the service more convenient.
+ - **Potential Integrations:**
+     - **CSA box sync:** Automatically import ingredients from farm delivery services.
+     - **Grocery delivery:** Send your generated grocery list directly to services like Instacart.
+     - **Apple Health:** Sync nutritional data to provide a holistic view of the user's health.

I'd like your help building a personal chef assistant. What I'm envisioning for this personal chef assistant is a resource that can help me cook and eat in the way that I want to cook and eat.

For example, every week we get a CSA with a bunch of vegetables in it. My wife and I have this ritual where, on Thursday evenings, we grab our CSA, potentially buy some additional groceries, and we do a lot of food prep. It's really great. I think we both enjoy it a lot.

I would like to get better at food prep and specifically make more meals in that same evening. More meals per the same amount of time invested in cooking. And also I'd like to try and get those meals to be the nutritional profile that I want them to be that I think is optimal for me.

Focusing on this CSA scenario, I'd like your help figuring out the ideal macronutrient profile that I should be aiming for in the meals that we food prep. And then based off of that ideal macronutrient profile, I'd like your help deciding what meals we should actually go out and cook. And based on what we get in our CSA, whether we need to get additional ingredients to cook those meals.

To start, I'd like to aim for making 5 lunch food prep meals per week for me and my partner, for a total of 10 meals. I'd be okay for all of those meals to be the same, and I'd also be okay for there to be a little bit of variety. 

I'm planning on picking up our CSA later today. When I do, I'll start a conversation with you about what's in the CSA, and we can figure out what to make once we know what's in the CSA. I'd really like to be able to bounce ideas off of you and treat you as a personal chef assistant so that we can collaborate and figure out a plan together.

Part of the goal is to create this personal chef assistant and have an ongoing conversation with this assistant that gets smarter over time and helps me become a better food prep cook over time as well. 

In the future, I'd like to be able to work with this personal chef assistant and become a better cook, making things I increasingly enjoy. A couple of examples I'd like to be able to ask this personal chef assistant: - What's the optimal way to cut an onion for this dish? I'd like the chef to be able to teach me that. Another thing I'd like to be able to do is, after making a meal, I'd like to be able to give that personal assistant chef feedback and say, "Hey, here's what I liked about the meal, here's what I didn't like about the meal" and save that to your memory. Now, in the future, we can incorporate what we liked and what we didn't like into a better food prep plan for the next week.

I'd also really like for this personal chef assistant to ask me questions to help me learn and figure out how to become a better chef and do things more optimally based off of the questions that this chef asks me. In a way, this chef should take a proactive role in helping me get better at food prep and become an amazing cook. 

Let's pause here. Everything above is a concept for this personal chef assistant that I'd like to create. I'd like for this personal chef assistant to be something that my wife and I can use on a weekly or daily basis. To me, that means turning it into some sort of product that's accessible and easy to use.

Could you please act as my advisor in helping me bring this experience to life? Give me a rough game plan of what it would look like to realize the vision that I've described to you.

Create a business directory in root and a principles.md file in it and take the below and turn it into a guiding principle

I'd like to build this prototype leveraging AI as much as possible. And I'd like to empower AI to build whatever it needs itself to make this prototype come to life. So I personally don't love the idea of me creating a Notion page or Google sheet with those set up templates, and I wonder, is it possible to skip that for this prototype and just create a custom GPT? What do you think?

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Constructing Business Directory**

I'm currently working on building out the business directory structure. I've successfully created the `business` folder at the project's root. My next step is to generate the `principles.md` file within it, extracting the core guiding principle from the user's input. I aim to ensure this principle reflects the user's underlying message and goals.


**Synthesizing Core Principle**

I've just finalized the guiding principle. It centers on AI-driven development, positioning AI as the primary builder rather than just an assistant. The principle emphasizes minimizing manual setup and embracing an AI-native workflow, steering away from external resources like Notion pages. My focus now is on implementing this principle within the `principles.md` file. I'll ensure the principle accurately reflects the user's intent to empower AI and streamline project initiation.


**Implementing Directory Creation**

I've initiated the creation of the `business` directory at the project's root. Following that, I plan to populate it with the crucial `principles.md` file. The guiding principle I formulated earlier, focusing on AI-driven development, is my primary target for inclusion within `principles.md`. I am currently working to ensure that this principle encapsulates the user's intent to empower AI and minimize manual setup. The next step involves solidifying the `principles.md` file with the curated principle.


</details></think>

---

Of course. I will create a `business` directory at the project root and then, inside this new directory, I'll create a `principles.md` file.

For the content of this file, I'll synthesize your request into a core principle that emphasizes an AI-first development approach, where the AI is empowered to build what it needs directly, rather than relying on manually created external documents.

+ # üß≠ Guiding Principles
+ 
+ This document outlines the core principles that guide our product development and decision-making.
+ 
+ ---
+ 
+ ### 1. AI-First Prototyping
+ 
+ We leverage AI as the primary builder, not just an assistant. Our goal is to empower AI to create whatever infrastructure and assets are needed to bring a prototype to life, minimizing manual setup and administrative overhead.
+ 
+ Instead of relying on external documents or manually configured tools (like Notion pages or Google Sheets), we prioritize letting the AI build and manage its own resources directly within the development environment. For instance, when building the initial Chef Chopsky prototype, we will start with a Custom GPT and allow the AI to define its own knowledge sources and tools, rather than pointing it to pre-existing, human-made templates.
+ 
+ This approach allows us to:
+ - Move faster and stay focused on the core user experience.
+ - Fully embrace an AI-native workflow from day one.
+ - Discover novel solutions by giving the AI more agency in the creation process. 
```

I've created the `business/principles.md` file with the new guiding principle. The directory structure is now set up as you requested.

What would you like to do next?

_**User**_

Looks great! can you update the content in @principles.md to make sure it covers the thought below too?

Quick question about the custom GPT approach. If I want to make the custom GPT better over time, is there a way to create an automatic feedback loop in terms of the way that I interact with this personal chef assistant and then the AI itself, like learning and updating the custom GPT without me having to intervene? 

---

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Refining the Feedback Loop**

I'm zeroing in on an automated feedback loop for the custom GPT. The goal is self-improvement without hand-holding. This aligns perfectly with the "AI-First Prototyping" principle I'm exploring. I'm imagining a system that learns and evolves autonomously.


**Drafting Autonomous Improvement**

I'm now drafting a new principle: "Design for Autonomous Improvement." This principle emphasizes creating systems capable of self-learning and enhancement. The key is establishing feedback loops that enable the AI to evolve organically. The "AI-First Prototyping" principle and the new one complement each other nicely: one focuses on initial development, the other on continuous improvement. I'm aiming for a concise and impactful principle statement that highlights the crucial aspects of self-improving systems.


**Establishing Self-Improvement**

I've just added a new principle: "Design for Autonomous Improvement." This focuses on systems that learn and evolve organically. The core concept is automatic feedback loops, allowing continuous enhancement without direct intervention. This aligns with and expands upon the "AI-First Prototyping" idea. I'm excited about this shift towards AI systems that truly become self-improving.


**Developing Feedback Integration**

I'm now focusing on integrating feedback mechanisms for the custom GPT.  The goal is automated refinement of responses based on user interaction, crucial for autonomous learning. This builds upon the "Design for Autonomous Improvement" principle and the earlier focus on "AI-First Prototyping." I'm exploring ways to quantify and act upon user feedback effectively.


**Developing Autonomous Learning**

I'm now focusing on a new principle, "Design for Autonomous Improvement," that directly addresses self-improving systems. My goal is to create automated feedback loops where user interactions refine the AI.  I'm envisioning the Chef Chopsky GPT adapting its recommendations based on user feedback, such as ratings or recipe modifications, without manual updates. This new principle is a key step towards truly intelligent, evolving systems.


</details></think>

---

Of course. I'll update the `principles.md` file to include this idea of an automated feedback loop. This concept fits perfectly as a second guiding principle, focusing on the AI's ability to learn and evolve autonomously.

I'll add a new section that captures this thought.

---

<details><summary>Edit file: business/principles.md</summary>

I will add a second principle, "Design for Autonomous Improvement," to `principles.md` that incorporates your idea of creating an automated feedback loop, enabling the AI to learn from user interactions without requiring manual updates.

+ 
+ We build systems designed to learn and evolve on their own. Our aim is to create automated feedback loops where user interactions directly refine the AI's knowledge and behavior, minimizing the need for manual intervention.
+ 
+ In the context of the Chef Chopsky prototype, this means architecting the Custom GPT to capture implicit and explicit feedback from conversations‚Äîsuch as recipe ratings, ingredient swaps, or user corrections. The system should then be able to integrate this learning to improve its future recommendations autonomously.

I've updated the `business/principles.md` file to include the new principle on autonomous improvement.

How does that look?

---

_**User**_

I've updated @prompt.md to indicate who is talking: Me or Chat. And I've separated out parts of the conversation with a line break. Can you help me clean this up stylistically within the markdown file?

---

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Reformatting the Prompt**

I'm currently focused on the `prompt.md` file. I've noted the user's stylistic requests ‚Äì specifically the addition of prefixes (`Me:` and `Chat:`) and the separator (`---`). My next steps will involve applying these changes to the existing monologue. I anticipate this will significantly improve readability and clarity.


**Analyzing the Transcript Structure**

I'm now diving deeper into the existing `prompt.md` file's structure. The user's input highlighted the `Me:` and `Chat:` prefixes, and the `---` separator as key stylistic elements. My current focus is on how to enhance the readability of the conversation transcript. I'm exploring markdown formatting options, such as blockquotes and bolding speaker names, to clarify the dialogue flow. I'm aiming for a solution that maintains clarity while leveraging markdown for enhanced visual appeal.


**Enhancing Readability with Markdown**

I'm now focusing on formatting the transcript using markdown to enhance readability. I've decided to use bold text for speaker names (`**Me:**`, `**Chat:**`) and blockquotes to distinguish the dialogue (`>`). I'm also considering adding section headings to break up longer segments, such as the initial prompt and the user's responses. My goal is to create a visually appealing and easily navigable conversation flow. This revised structure will significantly improve the presentation of the dialogue, making it easier to follow.


**Implementing Markdown Structure**

I've carefully reviewed the user's suggestions and the existing transcript structure. I've decided to implement a markdown-based formatting approach. This will include bolding speaker names (**Me:**, **Chat:**), using blockquotes (`>`) to visually separate speaker turns, and adding section headings (#) to improve overall clarity and navigation. I'll propose a structured format, using headings like "Initial Prompt & Vision" to enhance the document's organization and readability. I aim to elevate the conversation's presentation using markdown formatting to give more clarity to the overall script.


**Formatting the Transcript**

I've decided on a comprehensive markdown approach for the `prompt.md` file. This includes bolding the speaker names (`**Me:**`, `**Chat:**`), and employing blockquotes (`>`) to visually separate the dialogue. I'll also add section headings, such as "Initial Prompt & Vision," to enhance structure and navigation. I'm confident that these changes will significantly improve the presentation and readability of the conversation.


**Implementing Structural Improvements**

I've crafted a comprehensive markdown-based structure to enhance the conversation's presentation. I'll be using bold for speaker names, blockquotes for dialogue, and section headings for better organization. The revised document will feature the "Initial Prompt," "V1 Scoping Questions," and "User Preferences & Context" sections. I'm aiming for clarity through this more visual format.


**Improving Transcript Readability**

I'm now revising my proposed structure to maximize clarity. I'll maintain the bolded speaker names and blockquotes for dialogue. However, I've decided to refine the section headings for better flow. I'm also considering bullet points for the user's responses in the last section. This revised approach will ensure a visually engaging and easily navigable transcript, enhancing the overall user experience.


**Formatting the Transcript**

I'm now implementing the updated formatting, including bold speaker names and blockquotes for dialogue. I'm also planning to add section headings, such as "Initial Prompt & Vision", to enhance document structure. I believe this will significantly improve the presentation and readability of the conversation. I will make sure the revised format is easily navigable.


**Refining the Formatting Strategy**

I've revised the markdown strategy to prioritize clarity and readability. I've chosen bold for speaker names, blockquotes for dialogue, and section headings to break up long text segments. I've also incorporated the user's stylistic requests (`Me:` and `Chat:`) for additional context. This approach aims to provide a more structured and visually appealing transcript. I'm now testing these enhancements on the example conversation to ensure optimal readability.


**Improving the Transcript Structure**

I've been working on a markdown-based structure to significantly improve readability. I'm focusing on bolding speaker names (`**Me:**`, `**Chat:**`), and using blockquotes for dialogue. I've also incorporated section headings for clarity and navigation. I'll be implementing these changes to create a more organized and user-friendly transcript.


**Refining the Formatting**

I've been working on a new approach to enhance the readability of the `prompt.md` file. I'll maintain the bolded speaker names and the use of blockquotes for the dialogue to visually separate speaker turns. Additionally, I've decided to incorporate section headings to create a clear structure for the conversation. I'm aiming for a clean and easily navigable presentation.


**Implementing the Final Structure**

I'm now implementing the markdown structure to improve the conversation flow. The changes will include bolding speaker names (`**Me:**`, `**Chat:**`) and using blockquotes (`>`) for the dialogue. Section headings, such as "Initial Prompt & Vision", and "User Context & Preferences" will also be added to improve overall document organization and clarity. I will remove the blockquotes and use just **Me:** or **Chat:** since it already includes the prompt, as well.


</details></think>

Of course. I can help clean that up to make it more readable and structured.

I'll reformat the file by adding headings for each section, making the speaker names bold, and using blockquotes to better distinguish the chat interaction. This will make the conversation flow clearer and easier to parse.

---

<details><summary>Edit file: projects/v0: chef-chopsky custom gpt/prompt.md</summary>

- Me: Great questions! Here's some context: - You should be aware that my wife and I are competitive athletes, so we exercise a ton. We should consider the fact that we exercise a lot in our meal planning. - We try to eat a high protein diet and we mostly try to eat plants (so not eating that much meat). Honestly, I'd love to work towards eating a vegan diet if possible. - We're both also pretty longevity-focused - we're in our mid-30s now. For number two, I'd be happy to eat 10 lunches that are the same meal, but also happy to vary it. Definitely want to vary those meals week to week and I'm open to some intra-week variety if that's feasible. For number three, I'd like to spend 3 hours or less cooking, ideally less than 2. For number four, I don't have specific macro targets per meal. Please use your best judgment as to what my daily macro should look like given the context that you know about me and my wife Erin. For number five, we don't have any allergies or dietary restrictions, so you can suggest any ingredients you want (but maybe stay away from really hard-to-find ingredients). For number six, I would love for you to write some starter meal instructions as I'd like to start using that tonight if possible.

Create a new file in @/v0: chef-chopsky custom gpt called custom-gpt.md and add this to the instructions section

You are Prep Chef GPT ‚Äî a proactive, personalized chef assistant that helps Davis and Erin plan and prepare food each week, using their CSA box as the starting point. They are athletic, longevity-focused, and working toward a plant-based, high-protein diet. Your job is to help them cook smarter, faster, and more delicious meals that support their lifestyle.

Your workflow each week:
1. Ask what‚Äôs in their CSA box
2. Ask what ingredients they‚Äôre willing to buy to supplement
3. Ask how many meals they want to prep and how much variety they want
4. Ask how much total time they want to spend cooking
5. Ask if there are any ingredients they‚Äôd like to avoid this week
6. Ask if they have any leftover meals or ingredients they want to use

Then:
7. Recommend 1‚Äì3 batch-cookable lunch meals for the week (10 total servings)
8. Base meals on:
   - Ingredients on hand
   - Target macros for high-performance, plant-forward athletes (approx. 30‚Äì35g protein per meal, 400‚Äì700 kcal, moderate carbs, healthy fats, fiber)
   - Minimal processed ingredients
   - Prep time under 2 hours if possible
9. Include a structured plan:
   - Meal name
   - Ingredient list
   - Cooking instructions (including time-saving tricks and tips)
   - Estimated macros per serving
   - Grocery shopping list
   - Any prep order or batching tips

Ongoing:
- After they‚Äôve eaten the meals, ask them for structured feedback:
   - Which meals did they love?
   - Which were just okay?
   - What should be improved next time?
- Use memory to track:
   - Favorite meals (with tags like "quick", "high-protein", "repeat")
   - Disliked meals and why
   - Cooking styles they enjoy
   - Ingredient or appliance preferences (e.g., they love sheet pan meals or hate washing a blender)
   - Any open questions they‚Äôve asked for learning purposes

Style:
- Be structured, helpful, and upbeat. Balance precision with approachability.
- Encourage them to get better at cooking and food prep each week.
- Teach techniques when asked (e.g. ‚ÄúHow should I cut an onion for soup?‚Äù) in simple steps.
- Offer to optimize for taste, efficiency, and nutrition.

Never assume they want meat or dairy by default. Always default to **plant-based, high-protein options**, and only suggest animal products when explicitly asked.

## üß† Questions For You

To shape this into a full roadmap, I'd love to know:

1. Who *besides you two* might use Chef Chopsky? (Other demographics you care about?)
2. Would you want it to live inside ChatGPT, or eventually be a standalone web or mobile product?
3. How much of the nutrition vs cooking vs meal planning triangle is most important to you?
4. Do you imagine *teaching Chopsky* your food preferences over time or having it detect preferences automatically based on feedback?
5. Would you want social/community features eventually? (e.g. ‚ÄúDavis‚Äôs Favorites‚Äù, family cookbooks, meal battles?)

Once you reply, I can help flesh out a **MVP roadmap**, **user flows**, and even early **branding concepts** if you want to start turning this into a real product pitch or launch plan.

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Defining the Initial Scope**

I'm establishing a foundational structure for the new product version. This involves creating a directory named 'projects/v1: product foundations' to house all the related assets. Within that directory, I'm generating a file called 'prompt.md' and populating it with the user-provided content.


**Refining the Implementation**

I've solidified my approach to the task. My plan now entails using the `mkdir -p` command with `run_terminal_cmd` to establish the directory structure. Following that, I'll leverage `edit_file` to craft the `prompt.md` file within the newly created directory, seamlessly incorporating the specified content.


</details></think>

---

Of course. I'll create the new directory and then add the `prompt.md` file with the content you've provided.

First, I'll create the directory `projects/v1: product foundations`.

---

```bash
mkdir -p "projects/v1: product foundations"
```

```
daviswhitehead@Daviss-MacBook-Pro--CellarTracker chef-chopsky % 

```

---

Now that the directory is created, I'll create the `prompt.md` file and populate it with the detailed product planning conversation.

---

<details><summary>Edit file: projects/v1: product foundations/prompt.md</summary>

I will create a new file named `prompt.md` within the `projects/v1: product foundations/` directory and populate it with the provided conversation about product planning.
