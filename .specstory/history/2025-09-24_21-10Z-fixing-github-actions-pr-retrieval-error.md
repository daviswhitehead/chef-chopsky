# Fixing GitHub Actions PR retrieval error (2025-09-24 21:10Z)

_**User (2025-09-23 21:19Z)**_

Getting this error in the Get PR information step of @auto-fix-ci.yml . Can you fix please?

_**Assistant (default)**_

I can see the issue in the GitHub Actions workflow. The problem is in the logic that determines when to exit with an error code. Let me analyze and fix this:


---

Tool use: **read_file**

Read file: .github/workflows/auto-fix-ci.yml

---

I can see the issue! The problem is in line 99. The condition is checking if the event name is NOT `workflow_dispatch` AND NOT `push`, but the error shows it's running on a `workflow_run` event (which is triggered when another workflow completes). 

The logic should allow the workflow to continue when it's a `workflow_run` event, but currently it's exiting with code 1 because `workflow_run` is not in the allowed list.

Let me fix this:


---

Tool use: **search_replace**

```

Perfect! I've fixed the issue. The problem was that the workflow was exiting with code 1 when no PR was found for the branch, but it wasn't accounting for the `workflow_run` event type. 

The fix adds `workflow_run` to the list of allowed event types that won't cause the workflow to exit when no PR is found. This makes sense because:

1. **`workflow_dispatch`** - Manual trigger, should continue even without PR
2. **`push`** - Direct push events, should continue even without PR  
3. **`workflow_run`** - Triggered by other workflow completions, should continue even without PR

Now when the auto-fix workflow is triggered by a failed CI run on the `main` branch (which doesn't have an associated PR), it will set `PR_NUMBER="N/A"` and continue with the analysis phase instead of failing.

The workflow will now be able to:
- Analyze CI failures even when there's no associated PR
- Create debugging prompts for direct pushes to main branch
- Continue with the auto-fix process as intended

This should resolve the exit code 1 error you were seeing in the "Get PR information" step.
