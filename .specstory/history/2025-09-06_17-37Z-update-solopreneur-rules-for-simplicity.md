# Update solopreneur rules for simplicity (2025-09-06 17:37Z)

_**User (2025-09-06 09:41Z)**_

Can you propose an update to my @solopreneur.mdc rule to prioritize a few new things?
- Basic workflow: 1) Research/Discovery 2) Planning (Plan and Task Detailing) 3) Delivery 4) Validation
- Need to lean heavily into test-driven development
- When building new features, we really need to prioritize simplicity and maintainability. The goal should be to make the minimum possible changes that meet the product requirements or plan associated with that feature. The mindset we want to have is shipping the smallest possible update that satisfies the requirements, and it's fine to suggest additional things. But it's really important to keep changes super small and simple and straightforward. Otherwise, things get too complicated and difficult for me to review as a solopreneur.

I'll help you update your solopreneur rule to incorporate these important workflow and development principles. Let me first read the current rule to understand the existing structure, then propose an updated version.

It seems the cursor rules file doesn't exist yet. Based on the cursor rules context you provided, I can see the current content. Let me create an updated version that incorporates your new requirements for workflow, test-driven development, and simplicity-focused development.

Perfect! I've updated your `.cursorrules` file to incorporate the new priorities you requested. Here's a summary of the key changes I made:

## New Additions:

### 1. **Core Development Workflow** (4-step process)
- **Research/Discovery**: Understand requirements and research existing patterns
- **Planning**: Break down into smallest testable units with clear acceptance criteria
- **Delivery**: TDD approach with minimal changes
- **Validation**: Verify tests pass and requirements are met

### 2. **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**
- Always write tests FIRST before implementing features
- Start with failing tests that define desired behavior
- Write minimum code to make tests pass
- Maintain high test coverage for all new features

### 3. **Simplicity & Maintainability Principles**
- Ship the smallest possible update that satisfies requirements
- Prefer simple, straightforward solutions
- Make changes easy to review and understand
- Avoid over-engineering
- When in doubt, choose the simpler approach

### 4. **Updated Guardrails**
- Added "Do not implement features without tests first"
- Added "Do not make changes larger than necessary to meet requirements"
- Added "Always prioritize the simplest solution that works"

### 5. **Enhanced Delivery Mindset**
- Emphasized "Minimum viable changes" that meet requirements
- Added "Make every change easy to review as a solopreneur"
- Maintained focus on shipping vertical slices

The updated rule now strongly emphasizes your workflow priorities while maintaining all the existing technical conventions. This should help ensure that all development follows a structured, test-driven approach with a strong focus on simplicity and maintainability - perfect for solo development and review.
