# Automated CI Failure Resolution Plan (v4.1)

## Problem Statement

The current CI feedback loop is too slow and manual:
1. Developer proposes a fix
2. Creates PR on GitHub  
3. Waits for CI to run
4. Copies/pastes CI logs back to Cursor
5. Shares context with Cursor AI
6. Repeats cycle for each fix iteration

**Goal**: Empower Cursor's AI to automatically work through a series of fixes without manual PR creation and context sharing.

## Solution Overview

Implement an automated CI failure detection and resolution system that:
- Monitors CI failures in real-time
- Automatically analyzes failure logs using Cursor AI
- Creates fix branches and proposes PRs autonomously
- Provides quick feedback loops for iterative fixes
- Maintains security and quality gates

## Architecture Decision

**Pattern**: GitHub Actions + Cursor CLI + Background Agents
- **Why**: Leverages Cursor's native capabilities while maintaining GitHub workflow integration
- **Benefits**: 
  - No external dependencies beyond Cursor
  - Native GitHub integration
  - Can leverage existing CI infrastructure
  - Supports both automated and manual review workflows

## Technical Approach

### 1. CI Failure Detection & Analysis
- **Trigger**: GitHub Actions workflow that monitors CI completion
- **Analysis**: Cursor CLI analyzes failure logs and identifies root causes
- **Context**: Automatically gathers relevant code, test results, and error details

### 2. Automated Fix Generation
- **Fix Branch**: Creates persistent fix branch per PR (`ci-fix-{pr-number}`)
- **Targeted Fixes**: Applies minimal, safe changes based on failure analysis
- **Iterative Approach**: Can apply multiple fixes in sequence without manual intervention

### 3. PR Management & Communication
- **Quick-Create PRs**: Generates GitHub quick-create PR links for easy review
- **Comment Integration**: Posts/updates PR comments with fix explanations
- **Status Tracking**: Maintains fix branch state across multiple iterations

### 4. Quality & Security Gates
- **Automated Testing**: Runs tests on fix branches before proposing PRs
- **Code Quality**: Integrates with existing linting and formatting tools
- **Security**: Maintains existing security scanning and approval workflows

## Technical Specifications

### GitHub Actions Workflow Structure
```yaml
name: Auto Fix CI Failures

on:
  workflow_run:
    workflows: [CI, PR Validation]
    types: [completed]

jobs:
  analyze-and-fix:
    if: ${{ github.event.workflow_run.conclusion == 'failure' }}
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout and Setup
      - name: Install Cursor CLI
      - name: Analyze CI Failure
      - name: Generate Fix
      - name: Create Fix Branch
      - name: Test Fix
      - name: Create PR Comment
```

### Cursor CLI Integration
- **Authentication**: Use Cursor API key from GitHub secrets
- **Model**: GPT-4 or GPT-5 for analysis and code generation
- **Context**: Include relevant code, test results, and error logs
- **Safety**: Implement safeguards against destructive changes

### Fix Branch Strategy
- **Naming**: `ci-fix-{pr-number}-{attempt}` (e.g., `ci-fix-123-1`)
- **Persistence**: Maintain fix branches across multiple attempts
- **Cleanup**: Remove fix branches after PR merge or closure
- **Conflicts**: Handle merge conflicts gracefully

## Security & Quality Considerations

### Security Measures
- **Limited Permissions**: Use minimal required GitHub permissions
- **Code Review**: All automated fixes require human review
- **Audit Trail**: Maintain complete log of automated changes

- **Linting**: Maintain code quality standards
- **Formatting**: Ensure consistent code formatting
- **Dependencies**: Validate dependency changes

### Approval Workflows
- **Manual Review**: Human approval required for all PRs
- **Team Configuration**: Allow teams to customize approval requirements
- **Emergency Override**: Manual intervention capabilities

## Success Metrics

### Primary Metrics
- **Fix Success Rate**: Percentage of CI failures successfully resolved
- **Time to Fix**: Average time from failure detection to fix proposal
- **Iteration Count**: Number of fix attempts per failure
- **Developer Satisfaction**: Team feedback on automation effectiveness

### Secondary Metrics
