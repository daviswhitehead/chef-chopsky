# v4: Frontend-Agent Integration

This project implements end-to-end ChatGPT-like experience with LangChain agent integration.

## Project Structure

### Core Documentation
- **`plan.md`** - Main project plan and architecture decisions
- **`tasks.md`** - Comprehensive task breakdown and progress tracking

### Subprojects

#### ðŸ§ª [E2E Testing](./e2e-testing/)
End-to-end testing improvements and reliability enhancements.
- Focus: Playwright test suite hardening, race condition prevention, speed improvements
- Status: âœ… **COMPLETED** - 100% test success rate achieved

#### ðŸ¤– [Auto-Fix System](./auto-fix-system/)
Automated CI failure detection and resolution system.
- Focus: Cursor CLI integration, AI-powered failure analysis, automated fix generation
- Status: âœ… **PRODUCTION READY** - Real Cursor CLI integration complete

## Project Goals

**Primary User Story**: As a user, I can start a new conversation and send a message in the web UI, and I receive a helpful assistant reply generated by the Chef Chopsky agent.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- âœ… User can create conversation from UI; persists in Supabase
- âœ… Sending message triggers agent; both messages persist and display in order
- âœ… Minimal loading indicator; final text appears (buffered, no streaming)
- âœ… LangSmith traces with conversation_id, message_id, environment, model
- âœ… Anonymous usage works (no auth required)

## Architecture

**Integration Pattern**: Separate Agent Service over HTTP, with thin proxy in Next.js

**Why separate services?**
- Avoids bundling issues with LangChain/LangGraph in web browsers
- Best-in-class pattern used by ChatGPT, Discord, and other successful chat products
- Independent scaling of AI processing vs web serving
- Technology freedom: Next.js for web, Node.js for AI

## Current Status

**Overall Status**: ðŸš§ **IN PROGRESS** - Core integration complete, testing and automation systems production-ready

**Completed Components**:
- âœ… Backend Agent Service with LangChain integration
- âœ… Frontend API proxy with Supabase persistence
- âœ… UI integration with loading states and error handling
- âœ… E2E testing suite with 100% reliability
- âœ… Automated CI fix system with Cursor CLI integration

**Next Steps**:
- Deploy auto-fix system to production
- Enhanced fix generation and validation
- Performance optimization and monitoring
