## 🛠️ Implementation Details

### Required Files to Create/Modify

1. **`.github/workflows/auto-fix-ci.yml`** - Main auto-fix workflow
2. **`scripts/test-auto-fix.sh`** - Local testing script
3. **`docs/auto-fix-setup.md`** - Setup documentation

### Key Dependencies

- **Cursor CLI**: Command-line interface for AI operations
- **GitHub CLI**: For PR management and commenting
- **Node.js**: For running tests and validation
- **Git**: For branch operations and version control

### Environment Variables

- `CURSOR_API_KEY`: Authentication for Cursor AI
- `GITHUB_TOKEN`: Repository access (automatically provided)
- `NODE_ENV`: Set to 'test' for validation runs

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

### Test Scenarios

1. **Linting Failure**
   - Add ESLint error to code
   - Verify auto-fix detects and resolves
   - Check fix branch and PR comment

2. **TypeScript Error**
   - Introduce type error
   - Test auto-fix analysis and resolution
   - Validate fix correctness

3. **Test Failure**
   - Break existing test
   - Verify auto-fix can identify and fix
   - Check test passes after fix

4. **Multiple Failures**
   - Create PR with multiple issues
   - Test auto-fix handles multiple problems
   - Verify comprehensive fix proposal

### Validation Checklist ✅ ALL COMPLETED
