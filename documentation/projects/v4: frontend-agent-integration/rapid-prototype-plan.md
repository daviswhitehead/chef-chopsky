# Configure authentication
export CURSOR_API_KEY="your-api-key"

# Test basic functionality
cursor-agent --help
```

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

### Manual Testing
1. **Create Test Failure**: Intentionally break CI (add linting error)
2. **Trigger Workflow**: Push to PR branch
3. **Verify Detection**: Check that auto-fix workflow triggers
4. **Check Fix**: Verify fix branch is created and changes applied
5. **Review Comment**: Confirm PR comment appears with fix proposal

### Validation Checklist ✅ ALL COMPLETED
- ✅ CI failure detection works
- ✅ Basic analysis can identify failure types
- ✅ Fix branches are created correctly
- ✅ PR comments appear with fix proposals
- ✅ Quick-create PR links work

- **Logging**: Comprehensive logs for debugging

### Failure Handling
- **Graceful Degradation**: If fix fails, post explanation in PR comment
- **No Destructive Changes**: Only make additive/safe changes
- **Clear Communication**: Always explain what was attempted

## 📈 Success Metrics (MVP)

### Primary Success Criteria ✅ ALL ACHIEVED
- ✅ **Detection**: CI failures are automatically detected
- ✅ **Analysis**: Basic AI can identify common failure types
- ✅ **Fix Generation**: Simple fixes are applied correctly
- ✅ **Communication**: PR comments appear with fix proposals
- ✅ **Integration**: Quick-create PR links work

### Secondary Metrics
- **Fix Success Rate**: Percentage of attempted fixes that resolve CI
- **Time to Fix**: Time from failure detection to fix proposal
- **Developer Experience**: Ease of reviewing and merging fixes

## 🔄 Next Steps After MVP

1. **Expand Fix Types**: Add support for more complex failures
2. **Improve Analysis**: Refine prompts based on real failure data
3. **Add Validation**: Run tests on fix branches before proposing
4. **Enhance Communication**: Better PR comment formatting and status

### Future Enhancements (Next Week)

2. **Learning System**: Improve based on success/failure patterns
3. **Advanced Analysis**: Handle complex test failures and edge cases
4. **Team Features**: Configuration options and approval workflows

## 🎯 MVP Deliverables ✅ ALL COMPLETED

**Completed on September 19, 2025:**
1. ✅ **Working GitHub Actions Workflow**: Detects CI failures and triggers fixes
2. ✅ **Basic AI Analysis**: Successfully analyzes failures and generates fixes
3. ✅ **Fix Branch Management**: Creates and manages fix branches automatically
4. ✅ **PR Communication**: Posts fix proposals as PR comments
5. ✅ **End-to-End Testing**: Manual validation that the system works completely

**Real-World Test Results:**
- ✅ Successfully detected CI failure in PR #9
- ✅ Created fix branch `ci-fix-9` with analysis
- ✅ Posted detailed PR comment with fix proposal
- ✅ Generated working quick-create PR link: https://github.com/daviswhitehead/chef-chopsky/compare/ci-fix-9

## 🚀 Getting Started

**Step 1**: Set up Cursor CLI and GitHub integration
**Step 2**: Create the auto-fix workflow
**Step 3**: Test with intentional CI failure
**Step 4**: Iterate and refine based on results

This MVP approach gets us a working system today that can be iteratively improved, following the "ship fast, iterate faster" principle of successful consumer product teams.
