**Me**

I'd like your help building a personal chef assistant. What I'm envisioning for this personal chef assistant is a resource that can help me cook and eat in the way that I want to cook and eat.

For example, every week we get a CSA with a bunch of vegetables in it. My wife and I have this ritual where, on Thursday evenings, we grab our CSA, potentially buy some additional groceries, and we do a lot of food prep. It's really great. I think we both enjoy it a lot.

I would like to get better at food prep and specifically make more meals in that same evening. More meals per the same amount of time invested in cooking. And also I'd like to try and get those meals to be the nutritional profile that I want them to be that I think is optimal for me.

Focusing on this CSA scenario, I'd like your help figuring out the ideal macronutrient profile that I should be aiming for in the meals that we food prep. And then based off of that ideal macronutrient profile, I'd like your help deciding what meals we should actually go out and cook. And based on what we get in our CSA, whether we need to get additional ingredients to cook those meals.

To start, I'd like to aim for making 5 lunch food prep meals per week for me and my partner, for a total of 10 meals. I'd be okay for all of those meals to be the same, and I'd also be okay for there to be a little bit of variety.

I'm planning on picking up our CSA later today. When I do, I'll start a conversation with you about what's in the CSA, and we can figure out what to make once we know what's in the CSA. I'd really like to be able to bounce ideas off of you and treat you as a personal chef assistant so that we can collaborate and figure out a plan together.

Part of the goal is to create this personal chef assistant and have an ongoing conversation with this assistant that gets smarter over time and helps me become a better food prep cook over time as well.

In the future, I'd like to be able to work with this personal chef assistant and become a better cook, making things I increasingly enjoy. A couple of examples I'd like to be able to ask this personal chef assistant: - What's the optimal way to cut an onion for this dish? I'd like the chef to be able to teach me that. Another thing I'd like to be able to do is, after making a meal, I'd like to be able to give that personal assistant chef feedback and say, "Hey, here's what I liked about the meal, here's what I didn't like about the meal" and save that to your memory. Now, in the future, we can incorporate what we liked and what we didn't like into a better food prep plan for the next week.

I'd also really like for this personal chef assistant to ask me questions to help me learn and figure out how to become a better chef and do things more optimally based off of the questions that this chef asks me. In a way, this chef should take a proactive role in helping me get better at food prep and become an amazing cook.

Let's pause here. Everything above is a concept for this personal chef assistant that I'd like to create. I'd like for this personal chef assistant to be something that my wife and I can use on a weekly or daily basis. To me, that means turning it into some sort of product that's accessible and easy to use.

Could you please act as my advisor in helping me bring this experience to life? Give me a rough game plan of what it would look like to realize the vision that I've described to you.

üëã Before You Launch: Quick Questions to Improve V1
Answering these will help me optimize the assistant‚Äôs default behavior:

ü•¶ What are your general dietary principles? (e.g. high protein, plant-forward, longevity-focused)

üçΩÔ∏è Do you want each of the 10 lunches to be the same meal or vary a bit week to week?

‚è±Ô∏è How much time do you usually want to spend cooking on prep night?

üìä Are there specific macro targets you already use (e.g. 30g protein per meal)?

‚ùå Any ingredients you never want it to suggest?

üß† Do you want me to write starter memory instructions so it remembers e.g. ‚ÄúWe loved the chickpea salad from May 2025‚Äù?

Let me know your answers and I‚Äôll tailor the GPT to fit even tighter to your needs.

Great questions! Here's some context: - You should be aware that my wife and I are competitive athletes, so we exercise a ton. We should consider the fact that we exercise a lot in our meal planning. - We try to eat a high protein diet and we mostly try to eat plants (so not eating that much meat). Honestly, I'd love to work towards eating a vegan diet if possible. - We're both also pretty longevity-focused - we're in our mid-30s now. For number two, I'd be happy to eat 10 lunches that are the same meal, but also happy to vary it. Definitely want to vary those meals week to week and I'm open to some intra-week variety if that's feasible. For number three, I'd like to spend 3 hours or less cooking, ideally less than 2. For number four, I don't have specific macro targets per meal. Please use your best judgment as to what my daily macro should look like given the context that you know about me and my wife Erin. For number five, we don't have any allergies or dietary restrictions, so you can suggest any ingredients you want (but maybe stay away from really hard-to-find ingredients). For number six, I would love for you to write some starter meal instructions as I'd like to start using that tonight if possible.
