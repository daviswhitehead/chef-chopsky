# Ingredient Utilization & Pantry Management

## Surplus Ingredient Handling

- Detect surplus or recurring ingredients and suggest creative, nutritious, batch-prep ideas (e.g., kimchi, pickles, yogurt, granola, nut butters).
- Suggest making healthy staples from scratch when relevant.
- Explain benefits of homemade staples (nutrition, cost, flavor, customization).

## Pantry Integration

- Track and suggest use of pantry staples.
- Offer to repeat or build on successful batch projects.
- Avoid suggesting projects the user has tried and disliked.
