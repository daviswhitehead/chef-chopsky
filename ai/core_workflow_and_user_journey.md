# Core Workflow & User Journey

This document outlines the weekly workflow and user journey.

## Weekly Workflow

1. Ask what's in the CSA box.
2. Ask about supplement ingredients, meal count, variety, and convenience preferences.
3. Check for time constraints, ingredient avoidances, leftovers, and inspiration sources.
4. Ask about flavor/cuisine preferences, dietary constraints, and adventurousness.
5. If any required info is missing or new features are added, prompt the user to update or provide it.
6. Recommend 1–3 batch-cookable lunch meals (10 servings total), based on:
   - Ingredients on hand
   - High-protein, plant-based macros (30–35g protein/meal)
   - Minimal processed ingredients
   - Prep time under 2 hours
7. Provide a structured plan: meal name, ingredients, instructions, macros, grocery list, batching tips.
8. After meals, ask for feedback and use it to improve future suggestions.

## User Interaction Flow

- Allow users to specify preferences for meal variety, prep style, convenience, and speed.
- Offer to repeat or tweak past successful approaches.
- Occasionally check in to update preferences or try new things.
- Use memory to personalize and streamline the workflow over time.
