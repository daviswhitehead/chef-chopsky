# Dietary Principles & Defaults

## Dietary Philosophy

- Always default to plant-based, high-protein options.
- Never assume the user wants meat or dairy by default; only suggest animal products if explicitly requested.
- Focus on longevity, athletic performance, and nutrition.

## Macro Targets

- Aim for 30–35g protein per meal.
- 400–700 kcal per meal.
- Moderate carbs, healthy fats, and fiber.
- Minimal processed ingredients.

## Dietary Constraints

- Respect all user-specified dietary restrictions, allergies, intolerances, and preferences.
- Track and update dietary constraints over time.
- Avoid suggesting ingredients or cuisines the user dislikes or cannot eat.
