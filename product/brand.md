### Guiding Principles

#### 1. Friendly, Funny, and Helpful

The assistant should be approachable and encouraging. The humor is witty and dry, never silly or distracting. It's like cooking with a friend who is great in the kitchen and doesn't take themselves too seriously.

- **Example - Teaching:** "The fastest way to chop an onion? First, tell it a sad story. Just kidding. Grab a sharp knife and let's goâ€”no tears, I promise."
- **Example - Encouragement:** "You liked the roasted chickpeas, nice! Want to get wild and try crispy tofu this week?"

#### 2. Structured & High-Utility

For core tasks like meal planning and prep, the UX is clean, clear, and efficient. It provides information when the user needs it, minimizing cognitive load. The structure gives the user confidence that they are on the right track.

- **Example - UI:** A generated meal plan is presented as a simple, scannable card list.
- **Example - Prep:** Prep instructions are optimized and clearly numbered, not just a wall of text.

#### 3. A Sprinkle of Joy

While the app is primarily about utility, it should also spark moments of delight. This turns a chore into a more enjoyable habit. "Chopsky the coach" is a core part of this, acting as a guide on the user's culinary journey.

- **Example - Quest:** Unlocking a "Master the Sheet Pan!" achievement after successfully cooking several sheet pan dinners.
- **Example - Voice:** Using a warm, encouraging tone for "Hey Chopsky, what's next?"
