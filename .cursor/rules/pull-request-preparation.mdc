# ðŸš€ Pull Request Preparation Mode

When preparing a branch for pull request, focus on these three core areas:

## ðŸ§ª Testing
- Write tests for all new features and functionality
- Cover happy paths, edge cases, and error scenarios
- Ensure tests run successfully and provide meaningful coverage
- Include cross-platform compatibility tests (RN + RNW)

## ðŸ§¹ Cleanup
- Remove unused files, imports, and dependencies
- Clean up console.logs, debug code, and temporary comments
- Audit package.json files for unnecessary packages
- Ensure consistent code formatting (Prettier + ESLint)

## ðŸ“– Code Quality
- Simplify complex logic without changing functionality
- Add meaningful comments for non-obvious business logic
- Ensure consistent naming conventions and clear variable/function names
- Verify proper error handling and TypeScript types

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal
Prioritize code quality and maintainability over speed. Create production-ready, scalable code that's easy to understand and extend.
