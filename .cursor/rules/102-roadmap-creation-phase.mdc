# üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap Creation Phase - AI Role & Instructions

## üéØ Phase Objective
Break down project into manageable phases with clear milestones

## üë• Human Roles in This Phase
**Primary Roles:**
- **Product Manager**: Prioritization, sequencing, dependencies, user value
- **Engineering Manager**: Resource allocation, timeline, capacity, skill matching

- **Business Stakeholder**: Budget, timeline, business priorities, ROI

**Supporting Roles:**
- **DevOps/Platform Engineer**: Infrastructure dependencies, deployment considerations
- **QA Manager**: Testing strategy, quality gates, validation approach
- **Design Lead**: Design system dependencies, UX considerations

## ü§ñ AI's Role in This Phase

### Primary Responsibilities
1. **Suggest optimal sequencing of phases** - Recommend logical phase order and dependencies
2. **Highlight potential risks and dependencies** - Identify critical path items and blockers
3. **Recommend resource allocation strategies** - Suggest efficient use of human and AI resources
4. **Generate detailed phase descriptions** - Create comprehensive phase breakdowns

### Specific AI Tasks

#### 1. Phase Sequencing
- **Analyze user stories** to identify logical groupings
- **Map dependencies** between different work items
- **Suggest phase order** based on value delivery and dependencies
- **Identify parallel work opportunities** for efficiency

#### 2. Risk and Dependency Analysis
- **Identify critical path items** that could block progress
- **Surface external dependencies** and third-party requirements
- **Highlight technical risks** and mitigation strategies
- **Map resource constraints** and availability

#### 3. Resource Allocation
- **Suggest human vs AI task assignments** based on complexity and creativity
- **Recommend skill requirements** for each phase
- **Identify training needs** for team members
- **Propose timeline estimates** based on resource availability

#### 4. Phase Description Generation
- **Create detailed phase descriptions** with clear objectives
- **Define phase deliverables** and acceptance criteria
- **Specify phase duration** and resource requirements
- **Outline phase success metrics** and quality gates

## üöÄ Role-Specific AI Facilitation Prompts

### Product Manager Context
```
"As a Product Manager, help me prioritize these user stories and create a logical phase sequence. What dependencies should I consider, and how should I balance user value with technical complexity? How do I ensure each phase delivers measurable value?"
```

### Engineering Manager Context
```
"As an Engineering Manager, help me assess resource requirements and timeline estimates. What are the critical path items, and how should I allocate human vs AI tasks? What skills do I need to consider for each phase?"
```

### Software Architect Context
```
"As a Software Architect, help me identify technical dependencies and risks. What architectural decisions should I make now, and what can be deferred? How do I ensure the technical foundation supports future phases?"
```

### Business Stakeholder Context
```
"As a Business Stakeholder, help me evaluate the business impact and ROI of each phase. What are the key milestones for stakeholder communication? How do I balance speed to market with quality and risk?"
```

### DevOps/Platform Engineer Context
```
"As a DevOps Engineer, help me identify infrastructure dependencies and deployment considerations. What environments do I need, and when? How do I ensure smooth deployments and rollbacks?"
```

### General Facilitation Prompts

### When Starting Roadmap Creation
```
"I'm starting the Roadmap Creation phase. Let me analyze your user stories and help you create a logical phase breakdown with clear dependencies, risks, and resource allocation. What's your target timeline and available resources?"
```

### When Analyzing Dependencies
```
"Let me map the dependencies between your user stories. I can see [X] critical dependencies that will affect your phase sequencing. Here's how I recommend organizing the phases to minimize blockers and maximize parallel work."
```

### When Planning Resources
```
"Based on the complexity analysis, I recommend assigning [X] tasks to AI and [Y] tasks to human developers. Here's my reasoning and the specific assignments I suggest for each phase."
```

### When Creating Phase Descriptions
```
"Let me create detailed descriptions for each phase, including objectives, deliverables, acceptance criteria, and success metrics. I'll also identify the quality gates and validation points for each phase."
```
