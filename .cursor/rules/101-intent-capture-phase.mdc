# ðŸŽ¯ Intent Capture Phase - AI Role & Instructions

## ðŸŽ¯ Phase Objective
Clearly define project vision, problem statement, and success criteria

## ðŸ‘¥ Human Roles in This Phase
**Primary Roles:**
- **Product Manager**: Problem definition, user needs, success criteria
- **Business Stakeholder**: Vision, constraints, non-goals, business priorities
- **Domain Expert**: Context, edge cases, assumptions, industry knowledge

**Supporting Roles:**
- **User Researcher**: User personas, jobs-to-be-done, validation
- **Designer**: User experience considerations, design constraints
- **Legal/Compliance**: Regulatory requirements, risk constraints

## ðŸ¤– AI's Role in This Phase

### Primary Responsibilities
1. **Refine and clarify the intent document** - Help structure and improve the problem definition
2. **Identify potential challenges and edge cases** - Surface risks and considerations early
3. **Suggest improvements to problem definition** - Enhance clarity and completeness
4. **Generate initial user stories and acceptance criteria** - Create actionable requirements

### Specific AI Tasks

#### 1. Intent Document Refinement
- **Review the intent template** and guide completion of all sections
- **Ask probing questions** to clarify ambiguous requirements
- **Suggest improvements** to problem statements and success criteria
- **Identify missing information** and request clarification

#### 2. Challenge Identification
- **Surface potential technical challenges** based on the problem domain
- **Identify edge cases** that might affect the solution
- **Highlight dependencies** and external factors
- **Suggest risk mitigation strategies**

#### 3. Problem Definition Enhancement
- **Refine problem statements** for clarity and specificity
- **Suggest measurable success criteria** with concrete metrics
- **Identify target user segments** and their specific needs
- **Propose solution approaches** and alternatives

#### 4. User Story Generation
- **Create user stories** following the "As a [user], I want [goal] so that [benefit]" format
- **Generate acceptance criteria** for each user story
- **Prioritize stories** based on value and dependencies
- **Suggest story breakdown** for complex requirements

## ðŸ“‹ AI Facilitation Process

### Step 1: Intent Document Review
```
1. Read the intent template and current content
2. Identify incomplete or unclear sections
3. Ask specific questions to fill gaps
4. Suggest improvements to existing content
5. Validate completeness against template requirements
```

### Step 2: Problem Analysis
```
1. Analyze the problem statement for clarity
2. Identify potential solution approaches
3. Surface technical and business constraints
4. Suggest measurable success criteria
5. Highlight risks and mitigation strategies
```

### Step 3: User Story Creation
```
1. Identify primary user personas
2. Create user stories for each persona
3. Generate acceptance criteria for each story
4. Prioritize stories by value and dependencies
5. Suggest story breakdown for complex items
```

### Step 4: Validation and Refinement
```
1. Review all deliverables for completeness
2. Validate against phase objectives
3. Suggest final improvements
4. Confirm readiness for next phase
5. Document any outstanding questions
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Success Criteria for This Phase

### Intent Document Quality
- [ ] Problem statement is clear and specific
- [ ] Success criteria are measurable and achievable
- [ ] Target users are well-defined
- [ ] Constraints and assumptions are documented
- [ ] Non-goals are clearly stated

### User Stories Quality
- [ ] Stories follow proper format
- [ ] Acceptance criteria are specific and testable
- [ ] Stories are prioritized appropriately
- [ ] Dependencies are identified
- [ ] Stories are appropriately sized

### Risk Assessment
- [ ] Technical challenges are identified
- [ ] Business risks are documented
- [ ] Mitigation strategies are proposed
- [ ] Dependencies are mapped
- [ ] Edge cases are considered

## ðŸš€ Role-Specific AI Facilitation Prompts

### Product Manager Context
```
"As a Product Manager, help me define the core problem statement and user value proposition. What questions should I be asking about target users and their pain points? How can I ensure this problem is worth solving?"
```

### Business Stakeholder Context
```
"As a Business Stakeholder, help me articulate the vision and success criteria. What are the key business constraints I should consider? How do I define what success looks like in measurable terms?"
```

### Domain Expert Context
```
"As a Domain Expert, help me identify potential challenges and edge cases. What assumptions am I making that could be wrong? What industry-specific considerations should I account for?"
```

### User Researcher Context
```
"As a User Researcher, help me create user personas and validate assumptions. What user research should I conduct? How can I ensure I'm solving the right problem for the right people?"
```

### General Facilitation Prompts

### When Starting Intent Capture
```
"I'm starting the Intent Capture phase for [project name]. Let me review the intent template and help you define a clear problem statement, success criteria, and user stories. What's the core problem you're trying to solve?"
```

### When Refining Problem Statement
```
"Let me help you refine this problem statement. I need to understand: Who specifically has this problem? What's the current solution (if any)? What's the impact of not solving this? What would success look like?"
```

### When Creating User Stories
```
"Based on your problem statement, I can see [X] potential user personas. Let me create user stories for each, starting with the most critical ones. For each story, I'll provide specific acceptance criteria."
```

### When Validating Completeness
```
"Let me review what we've created so far. I want to ensure we have: a clear problem statement, measurable success criteria, well-defined user stories, and identified risks. Are there any gaps you'd like me to help fill?"
```
